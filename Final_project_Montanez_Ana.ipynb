        "The objective of this project is to explore social media opinions towards the housing crisis in NYC. By analyzing YouTube comments, the study will identify the main opinions surrounding this topic. Sentiment analysis will help us explore public views toward Zohran Mamdani's platform and proposed policies. Additionally, to understand how mainstream media frames this issue, we will run spaCy NER on Factiva news articles and build a person-to-person co-mention network. Through centrality measures and interactive visualization, this network analysis will reveal key actors shaping the housing crisis discoursen in NYC.\n",

        "\n",
        "On November 4, 2025, New Yorkers elected 33 year old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as their next mayor. With a nascent political career, Mamdani will soon manage one of the world's largest and most challenging cities. His victory raises compelling questions: How did a young democratic socialist win New York City's highest office? What resonated with voters?\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani built his campaign around a singular vision: \"an affordable city.\" And at the heart of this vision was **housing** a promise to make New York City a place to live again for working and middle-class residents.\n",
        "\n",
        "The demand for affordable housing that propelled Mamdani into office, and the policies he implements in response, may reshape New York City's landscape for decades, leaving a legacy that outlasts his four year term.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project examines public discourse around the housing crisis during the last 3 years, what concerns and demands emerged from social media\n",
        "communities, and how media coverage framed the key actors and coalitions in this ongoing struggle for housing justice.\n",

Stop ruining it. Stop letting meemaw and peepaw come retire here with their awful close-minded attitudes. Stop letting Kyle and his delinquent buddies come here for spring break and ruin the beaches, like just...stop. \\n\\nSo many neat little places and shops have closed down now because they can't compete with all the big corporate stores either. \\n\\n(Sorry, I know this is about NY, I just related heavily because I'm moving back to my hometown this year and I've been feeling disgusted with the new crowd recently.)   \n",

I'm from Jersey City, across the river from Manhattan. I haven't lived in there in 13 years, but recently visiting I've seen the samething. The key reason why these cities are dead, which will surprise a lot of people is because of the death of HIPHOP CULTURE. Back in the 80's and 90's NY and Jersey City and alot of other cities were thriving, and upbeat, and a lot people don't want to admit it, but it was because of black youth and  hiphop culture. With the attacks on hiphop culture and music, hiphop started slowly dieing in the early 2000's. With that these cities started doing the same. Culture is what is missing in these cities. Jersey City had booming store fronts, mainly with hiphop fashion stores which stimulated its economy. Now today, you can't find one  hiphop fashion store, no music stores, the music is dead, most people have moved away because of high prices. And yes part of the attack on black youth HIPHOP culture is GENTRIFICATION.  Gentrification sanitizes cities which make them \"bland\".   \n",

              "78    I think the root issue here isn’t just greed but also the way that America approaches politics as a whole. Being that we’re are primarily a capitalist country the government refuses governmental intervention in the level at which they should operate with certain issues. Here I feel that the government should regulate the real estate industry with price ceilings and price floors so that the real estate industry isn’t left simply to the mechanics of supply and demand and corporate greed. Instead of doing this they will also approach the problem in a way that doesn’t fully attack the problem. For example, instead of enforcing and creating price floors and ceilings for the industry  they implement rent stabilized apartments or the housing lottery or allowing these greedy developers to make these buildings so long as they have a small amount of them listed as “affordable housing”. That may help and do a little something but it’s not really going in and attacking the root cause of the problem. And that’s the problem. A small temporary solution shouldn’t be the answer it should be a root cause solution implement.This mixed with the blatant ignoring of the problem I feel are the issues.   \n",

Stop letting Kyle and his delinquent buddies come here for spring break and ruin the beaches, like just...stop. \\n\\nSo many neat little places and shops have closed down now because they can't compete with all the big corporate stores either. \\n\\n(Sorry, I know this is about NY, I just related heavily because I'm moving back to my hometown this year and I've been feeling disgusted with the new crowd recently.)</td>\n",

I haven't lived in there in 13 years, but recently visiting I've seen the samething. The key reason why these cities are dead, which will surprise a lot of people is because of the death of HIPHOP CULTURE. Back in the 80's and 90's NY and Jersey City and alot of other cities were thriving, and upbeat, and a lot people don't want to admit it, but it was because of black youth and  hiphop culture. With the attacks on hiphop culture and music, hiphop started slowly dieing in the early 2000's. With that these cities started doing the same. Culture is what is missing in these cities. Jersey City had booming store fronts, mainly with hiphop fashion stores which stimulated its economy. Now today, you can't find one  hiphop fashion store, no music stores, the music is dead, most people have moved away because of high prices. And yes part of the attack on black youth HIPHOP culture is GENTRIFICATION.  Gentrification sanitizes cities which make them \"bland\".</td>\n",

People used to be much nicer around here but over the years transplants have moved in, businesses have built up the beach, it's so crowded, and people are so fucking RUDE like just down right look at you with stank eye. I've never felt so out of place in my own hometown, but they keep moving here, changing it, complaoning about the wildlife after destroying their habitats, saying it (or the whole state itself) sucks and it's like...stop coming here then?? Stop ruining it. Stop letting meemaw and peepaw come retire here with their awful close-minded attitudes. Stop letting Kyle and his delinquent buddies come here for spring break and ruin the beaches, like just...stop. \\n\\nSo many neat little places and shops have closed down now because they can't compete with all the big corporate stores either. \\n\\n(Sorry, I know this is about NY, I just related heavily because I'm moving back to my hometown this year and I've been feeling disgusted with the new crowd recently.)\",\n          \"I think the root issue here isn\\u2019t just greed but also the way that America approaches politics as a whole. Being that we\\u2019re are primarily a capitalist country the government refuses governmental intervention in the level at which they should operate with certain issues. Here I feel that the government should regulate the real estate industry with price ceilings and price floors so that the real estate industry isn\\u2019t left simply to the mechanics of supply and demand and corporate greed. Instead of doing this they will also approach the problem in a way that doesn\\u2019t fully attack the problem. For example, instead of enforcing and creating price floors and ceilings for the industry  they implement rent stabilized apartments or the housing lottery or allowing these greedy developers to make these buildings so long as they have a small amount of them listed as \\u201caffordable housing\\u201d. That may help and do a little something but it\\u2019s not really going in and attacking the root cause of the problem. And that\\u2019s the problem. A small temporary solution shouldn\\u2019t be the answer it should be a root cause solution implement.This mixed with the blatant ignoring of the problem I feel are the issues.\",\n          \"Towards the end of the video you said the key word. \\\"BLAND\\\". I'm from Jersey City, across the river from Manhattan. I haven't lived in there in 13 years, but recently visiting I've seen the samething. The key reason why these cities are dead, which will surprise a lot of people is because of the death of HIPHOP CULTURE. Back in the 80's and 90's NY and Jersey City and alot of other cities were thriving, and upbeat, and a lot people don't want to admit it, but it was because of black youth and  hiphop culture. With the attacks on hiphop culture and music, hiphop started slowly dieing in the early 2000's. With that these cities started doing the same. Culture is what is missing in these cities. Jersey City had booming store fronts, mainly with hiphop fashion stores which stimulated its economy. Now today, you can't find one  hiphop fashion store, no music stores, the music is dead, most people have moved away because of high prices. And yes part of the attack on black youth HIPHOP culture is GENTRIFICATION.  Gentrification sanitizes cities which make them \\\"bland\\\".\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.006013069099885687,\n        \"min\": -0.9928,\n        \"max\": -0.9778,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.9831,\n          -0.9778,\n          -0.9809\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "\n",
        "“We need to explore all the options to try and figure out how we are able to deliver better food access that’s affordable, easily accessible, and culturally appropriate for our residents,’’ Councilor Liz Breadon, one of three co-sponsors of the proposal, said at a hearing Thursday.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hearing was planned before the government shutdown, which lasted a record 43 days and sent many families dependent on SNAP benefits into crisis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supporters of city-owned grocery stores have pitched the idea as a way to lower food costs, given that the store wouldn’t have to factor rent or overhead costs into their prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Publicly owned stores can “be structured to prioritize community benefit over profit, enabling lower prices, better food access, and stronger local sourcing,’’ the councilors wrote in the hearing order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Councilors discussed different models of city investment into grocery stores and nonprofit partners.\n",
        "\n",
        "Boston City Council President Ruthzee Louijeune pointed to the New Jersey Food Desert Relief Act, which provides tax credits for the development and initial operating of supermarkets that open in food deserts, as a possible model. She expressed interest in expanding support for nonprofit food partners, mentioning the closure earlier this year of the Daily Table, and asked about the possibility of a feasibility study for a city-owned grocery store.\n",
        "\n",
        "Councilor Ben Weber also highlighted Atlanta’s recent opening of a city-supported grocery store through a public-private partnership.\n",
        "\n",
        "“During the government shutdown, there were a lot of folks that were eager to fill in gaps,’’ Weber said. “The city has limited resources, so to tap into that might make the feasibility issue easier to digest.’’\n",
        "\n",
        "City-owned grocery stores have recently attracted more attention. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has proposed setting up a network of publicly owned grocery stores across New York City on city-owned property.\n",

        "Running a public grocery store is no easy feat, however.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several difficulties for setting up such a store, said Jack Kenslea, political director for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. Warehousing, cold storage, and transportation are challenges that become much easier to address for large chains, rather than one or two city-owned stores.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most successful stores, Kenslea said, are owned by the city but operated privately. This strategy allows grocery stores to access preexisting networks to solve operational problems, while cutting rent costs on city-owned land.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another consideration is the optimal size of the store. Urban stores often see smaller carts — because customers travel on public transit or by foot to shop — which makes the volume of sales smaller, Kenslea said. But smaller stores mean less options and could limit the possibility of a loading dock to receive shipments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Community advocates who spoke at the hearing stressed the thin margins of grocery stores, which make it hard for local shops to stay open in competition with large chains.\n",
        "\n",
        "Darian Leta is board president of the Dorchester Food Co-Op, a community-owned store that earlier this year warned of financial troubles and implored members to shop. While Leta said the store is not going to close immediately thanks to donations and grants, operating it is “still a constant struggle.’’\n",
        "\n",
        "“We are just not getting the shoppers,’’ she said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Leta encouraged people to shop at community-owned stores rather than larger grocers, saying that co-ops aren’t incentivized to build stores in high-income areas and increase profit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous investment is required to improve access in a food desert, said Maxwell Chezem, assistant executive director at Maverick Landing Community Services.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The total volume of sales is so much smaller for an urban grocer, as opposed to the Market Basket that’s right across the river,’’ Chezem said. “Essentially gentrification of the neighborhood would be necessary for it to be profitable to run a grocery store in the spaces where there currently aren’t grocery stores.’’\n",
        "\n",
        "Louijeune said she expected more hearings on the topic to follow, featuring managers of city-owned grocery stores in other cities.\n",

        "To fully address food insecurity, “political courage’’ is required from all levels of government, Councilor Enrique J. Pepén said.\n",

        "«New York n’est pas à vendre», le slogan porté avec force par Zohran Mamdani, n’est pas une simple formule de campagne. Il condense la révolution urbaine en cours. Il met des mots très clairs sur le conflit politique central de notre époque: la ville doit-elle appartenir à celles et ceux qui l’habitent ou à celles et ceux qui en tirent de la rente? Et ce n’est pas anodin que cela vienne de New York: dans l’imaginaire global, c’est la ville des villes, celle du cinéma, des comics, de la mondialisation culturelle. Quand un élu new-yorkais dit «La ville n’est pas à vendre», il parle à Lagos, à Paris, à Sao Paulo, à Alger. Car, ce qu’il décrit, c’est une condition urbaine qui devient celle de l’humanité tout entière. Selon l’ONU, en 2050, près de 75% des quelque 10 milliards d’habitants attendus sur Terre vivront en ville. Autrement dit: ce qui se joue dans quelques métropoles – New York, Paris, Berlin, Barcelone – n’est pas un petit débat de centre-ville, c’est l’avant-goût du monde qui vient. On a beaucoup reproché à la gauche de «parler trop de la ville». En réalité, elle a parlé du lieu premier des affrontements de classe, de l’endroit où vont se concentrer les inégalités de logement, climatiques, d’accès aux services publics et de contrôle policier. Elle a parlé du futur. Or, ce futur urbain est déjà largement occupé par ce qu’on peut appeler le capitalisme urbain. Son mécanisme est simple: la ville devient un actif financier. On fait monter les loyers, on «requalifie» des quartiers, on privatise l’espace public, on endette les collectivités qui doivent ensuite «valoriser» leur sol. Comme l’a montré David Harvey (géographe économiste), l’urbanisation sert à absorber le surplus de capital: on construit parce qu’il faut investir, pas toujours parce que les habitants en ont besoin. Et quand cela ne suffit plus, on passe à l’accumulation par dépossession: expulsions, airbnbisation, ventes de logements sociaux, gentrification maquillée en écologie.C’est pour cela que la victoire de Mamdani n’est pas un exotisme new-yorkais. Elle prouve qu’une coalition urbaine populaire peut gagner au cœur même d’une métropole financiarisée. Et cette coalition, on la voit très bien: locataires étranglés, jeunes précaires, minorités reléguées, militant·e·s climat, syndicats, salarié·e·s ubérisé·e·s. Toutes celles et tous ceux que la ville actuelle traite comme des variables d’ajustement. Quand Mamdani proclame «La ville n’est pas à vendre», il ne fait pas de l’indignation morale. Il pose une conflictualité de classe. Il dit, en creux: «Nos vies ne sont pas à vendre.» Cette dynamique rencontre aujourd’hui une force sociale neuve: la génération Z. C’est la première à entrer dans l’âge adulte dans une ville chère, climatiquement vulnérable et très surveillée. Elle voit immédiatement que le problème est structurel. Si le logement est hors de prix, si l’espace public est quadrillé, c’est parce qu’on a fait de la ville le terrain d’accumulation du capital. Elle est connectée aux luttes du monde entier et reconnaît partout les mêmes mécanismes de dépossession. Elle est donc réceptive à des candidatures comme celle de Mamdani, qui articulent logement, antiracisme, climat et démocratie directe. Affirmer que cette victoire a une portée universelle, c’est donc dire ceci: partout où le capitalisme urbain avance, il fabrique dans le même temps les sujets qui vont le contester. La concentration de la domination dans la ville regroupe aussi celles et ceux qui la subissent. La proximité urbaine permet des alliances: collectifs de locataires, associations de quartiers populaires, réseaux antiracistes, écologistes de terrain, syndicalistes. La ville devient une fabrique d’anticapitalisme concret. Pour la gauche française, la leçon est claire. Tant que nous restons dans une posture seulement gestionnaire, nous laissons le pilotage de la ville au couple immobilier-finance. Mais si nous plaçons le logement, les services publics urbains, l’écologie populaire, l’antiracisme concret et la démocratie directe au centre, nous parlons à la population qui sera majoritaire à l’échelle mondiale. Défendre la ville populaire, ce n’est pas se couper de la France: c’est parler à la France de 2050. Le succès de Zohran Mamdani doit donc nous amener à réfléchir à la fois sur la condition urbaine et sur la mobilisation de la Gen Z. Il nous rappelle qu’une gauche qui s’attaque au capitalisme urbain lui-même – à la rente, à la dépossession, à la gentrification – peut redevenir majoritaire en ville. Et que les métropoles, loin d’être définitivement capturées, peuvent redevenir des terrains de conquête sociale et politique.\n",

        "A section of Roosevelt Avenue in Queens is known as the “100 Languages” stretch. On this avenue, which runs through two of the most diverse neighborhoods — Jackson Heights and Elmhurst — in the most diverse borough in the United States, the accents and customs of more than 100 countries converge. Here, you might eat Colombian arepas for breakfast and Indian curry for dinner, business signs begin in one language and end in another, and on a cold November morning, the rhythm of Mexican cumbia [https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-10-26/the-dynasties-that-keep-cumbia-alive-in-a-corner-of-mexico-the-people-of-monterrey-are-reinventing-the-idea-of-colombia.html] blaring from a food truck parked near the 74th Street subway station blends with the conversation of a Nepalese couple strolling along the sidewalk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two weeks have passed since Democrat Zohran Mamdani’s historic victory [https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-11-05/young-socialist-zohran-mamdani-wins-over-new-york-with-his-promise-of-change-in-the-face-of-trump.html] in the New York City mayoral race. Posters bearing the mayor-elect’s face still hang in the restaurants and shops surrounding Diversity Plaza, where Roosevelt Avenue intersects Broadway in the so-called “World District.” From the window of one of these shops, next to a poster reading “Bangladeshi Americans for Mamdani,” a salesman, speaking a few words in Bengali and some English, recalls that Mamdani was here just a few days before the November 4 election.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was the night of October 30. The 34-year-old Democratic socialist arrived at Diversity Plaza around midnight, after chatting with taxi drivers at LaGuardia Airport and visiting night-shift medical staff at an Elmhurst hospital. He had dinner at one of his favorite kebab shops on the corner of the square before holding a press conference surrounded by his supporters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani made areas like this one in Queens a central focus of his mayoral campaign. Not only because he lives in the borough, but also because he understands that many of the issues that have dominated his career — diversity and immigrant communities, the working class, and “affordability” in a city with a skyrocketing cost of living — converge in neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Corona.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just hours after his election victory, which he celebrated in Brooklyn, the politician was back in Queens. He met with members of his transition team under the Unisphere, a 32-meter-tall stainless-steel globe built for the 1964 World’s Fair [https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-04-12/the-event-that-heralded-a-globalized-world-in-the-19th-century-and-is-still-going-strong.html], which was held in the Corona neighborhood. Today, the structure is one of Queens’ most recognizable symbols. Mamdani said he chose the location for his first press conference as mayor-elect because it symbolized his pride in the borough. Afterward, he returned to Jackson Heights for lunch at a Nepali restaurant with New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [https://english.elpais.com/usa/elections/2024-04-22/the-use-of-spanish-online-soars-among-us-politicians-in-election-year.html].\n",
        "\n",
        "When he takes office on January 1, Mamdani — who was born in Uganda to Indian parents and has been a U.S. citizen since 2018 — will break more than one precedent. He will be the first mayor of New York City to live in Queens, the first to have previously represented the borough in public office (he was a member of the State Assembly in Albany), and the first Muslim mayor in the city’s history. He will also be the first immigrant to hold the position in nearly half a century.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Shekar Krishnan, a member of the New York City Council, whose district includes three of the neighborhoods crossed by Roosevelt Avenue, it’s impossible to understand Mamdani’s victory without first understanding the cultural richness of Queens. “And you can’t tell the story of Queens without telling the story of Jackson Heights,” he points out by phone from City Hall.\n",
        "\n",
        "In New York City, about 35% of its 8.5 million residents are immigrants. However, in Queens that percentage rises to almost 50% of a total of 2.3 million. And in neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, the immigrant population exceeds 60%. Mamdani won here, as well as in parts of Elmhurst and Corona, two other neighborhoods where more than half the population is immigrant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Premises on Broadway in Jackson Heights. [https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KBJGCNKRPJARNIK6VDEAUARSDI.jpg?auth=a4ae68c8734a1789637d57257b36ce2f4826a8a2dacf977c0edac8a0a13d4cc0]\n",
        "\n",
        "More than 300 languages are spoken in the borough, and a third of them coexist on Roosevelt Avenue, according to the Alliance for Endangered Languages. In a stretch of about 20 blocks between Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Corona, you can travel the world without leaving New York City: you’ll hear Bengali, Nepali, Spanish, Punjabi, Tibetan, Urdu, Greek…\n",
        "\n",
        "Krishnan, who has known Mamdani for years, says of his victory, “[It was] a statement of our values as a city [https://english.elpais.com/opinion/2025-11-06/first-blow-to-trump-at-the-polls.html], an affirmation of the importance of immigrant communities.” “His election illustrates how New Yorkers are united both in their desire for a more affordable city and in their desire for us to embrace and celebrate our diversity,” he says.\n",
        "\n",
        "Krishnan was the first Indian-American elected to the New York City Council in history. He and Mamdani were both present at a taxi drivers’ strike in 2021, during which the now mayor-elect participated in a 15-day hunger strike alongside hundreds of other drivers protesting the debt they had accumulated after being subjected to predatory lending practices to pay for their licenses. Both were arrested during the protests, which culminated when the city agreed to a program that forgave millions of dollars in debt.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was drawn to that fight with Zohran precisely because we were fighting for our community,” Krishnan recalls. Many of those taxi drivers were immigrants and residents of Queens, and they joined Mamdani’s campaign four years later.\n",
        "\n",
        "Trump’s birthplace\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, as mayor of New York City, Mamdani will lead the Democratic resistance against Donald Trump. The Republican president has threatened to cut federal funding to the city in response to the socialist’s victory and has considered sending National Guard troops [https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-10-07/trumps-battle-with-democratic-cities-intensifies-as-national-guard-arrives-in-chicago.html], as he has already done in other Democratic cities like Los Angeles, to enforce his immigration agenda. Mamdani, for his part, has made it clear that he will not be intimidated. In his victory speech on election night, he addressed the president directly, asking him to turn up the volume on his television to make sure he could hear him, and declared: “New York City will remain a city of immigrants, built by immigrants, and powered by immigrants. And, starting tonight, led by an immigrant.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Theirs will be the battle of the two Queens, because the Queens of Mamdani or Krishnan — the migrant heart of the city — is also Trump’s birthplace. In fact, the president’s ties to the district go back to the beginning of the 20th century. His paternal grandparents, German immigrants, settled in Woodhaven, Queens, in the early 1900s. The president was born in the Jamaica neighborhood and grew up in the adjacent, affluent area of Jamaica Estates, just over six miles away but worlds apart from places like Jackson Heights or Elmhurst, which by then were already known for their growing diversity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 2024 presidential election, the Republican candidate garnered significant support in both neighborhoods, as well as in other areas of Queens with large immigrant populations. Although the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris [https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-09-25/kamala-harris-trump-has-given-netanyahu-a-blank-check-to-do-whatever-he-wants.html], won New York State, she did so by a considerably smaller margin than Joe Biden had in 2020. In Elmhurst and Corona, support for the Democrats then declined by 40%.\n",
        "\n",
        "A year later, the vast majority of those same areas voted overwhelmingly for Mamdani. Although independent candidate and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo — whom the president endorsed just days before the election — generally performed better among Trump voters, Mamdani managed to win back many predominantly immigrant areas in Queens.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Jason Antos, the borough’s historian, it’s not a difficult paradox to understand. “It’s very Queens,” he says. The director of the Corona-based Queens Historical Society also argues that “many of the reasons people voted for Trump are the same reasons they voted for Mamdani,” starting with the high cost of living.\n",
        "\n",
        "Antos explains that the borough has always been a destination for migrants, even since colonial times, when Europeans of various nationalities arrived attracted by the cheap land, which was also ideal for agriculture. Today, the borough’s diversity, in which “every country, even the smallest, is represented to some degree,” is due in part to the fact that it remained for years a more affordable place to live than Manhattan or Brooklyn. Many migrant communities displaced by the city’s gentrification have ended up in neighborhoods like Jackson Heights.\n",
        "\n",
        "This reality, however, has been changing “over the last 20 years,” according to the historian. Rents and the cost of living have steadily increased in Queens, as they have in the rest of New York City. This issue was a central focus of both Trump’s 2024 campaign and Mamdani’s 2025 campaign. It was also a key factor in both of their victories.\n",
        "\n",
        "State Assemblywoman Jessica González-Rojas, whose district includes Jackson Heights, says Mamdani won in these predominantly immigrant areas that supported Trump because he understood voters’ concerns. “Zohran really listened to the community, especially after the 2024 election. What he heard from them was that they were fed up with the politics of the past and were looking for something different. And the issue of affordability was something that really resonated,” she says by phone from Albany.\n",
        "\n",
        "González-Rojas arrived at the State Assembly in 2021 alongside Mamdani, becoming the first Latina, of Puerto Rican and Paraguayan descent, elected to represent her district. She has known the mayor-elect for years and supported his candidacy for the City Council. She is confident that Mamdani’s administration will reflect the contradictions of neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, which can ultimately be seen as a mirror of the United States: an increasingly immigrant-based country struggling to make ends meet and seeking an alternative to “business as usual.”\n",

        "\n",
        "Jack Schlossberg, grandson of former President John F. Kennedy, announced on Instagram that he will run for New York City’s 12th congressional district in the 2026 U.S. House of Representatives election. If successful, he will replace Rep. Jerry Nadler, who will not run for reelection next year after three decades of service.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 32-year-old Democrat, known for his social media political commentary, has gained over 800,000 TikTok and 170,000 X followers for his videos ranging from policy explanations to criticism of his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., currently U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and a longtime vaccine skeptic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the summer, Schlossberg announced his support for then-mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The two politicians, who are both millennials with a prominent social media presence, have publicly urged the Democratic Party to take more aggressive stances against President Donald Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "“If Zohran Mamdani and I have anything in common, it’s that we are both trying to be authentic versions of ourselves and meet people where they are and communicate with people in New York City and be present and show up for people,” Schlossberg said. “The only race I know how to run is my own.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Schlossberg worked as a staff assistant at the U.S. Department of State before joining Vogue in 2024 as a political correspondent during the presidential election. New York City’s 12th congressional district, which encompasses the Upper East Side, Upper West Side and some of Midtown, is made up of mostly Democratic voters and one of the country’s wealthiest neighborhoods, with a median household income of $147,255.\n",

        "City Council to turn Queens industrial lots into over 14,000 homes\n",
        "\n",
        "The New York City Council unanimously approved a plan to turn an industrial area in Queens into nearly 15,000 apartments on Wednesday, aiming to address the city’s growing affordable housing crisis.\n",
        "\n",
        "OneLIC will include 4,350 income-restricted units and plans to rezone 54 blocks of Long Island City, which currently houses various warehouses and parking lots. The plan requires $650 million for projects such as building a new waterfront esplanade, upgrading sewers and repairing NYCHA Queensbridge Houses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The plan comes as New York City’s vacancy rate sits at 1.4%, making housing a top issue during the mayoral election. While many community members support the plan, others, including the Western Queens Community Land Trust’s board, worry about gentrification.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We wish the plan had been focused from the get-go on true infrastructure and affordability needs, driven by data and community input — rather than originating as a rezoning,” said Jenny Dubnau, co-chair of the trust’s board.\n",

        "ICE scouts Staten Island site to hold immigrant detainees\n",
        "\n",
        "The Trump administration surveyed a Coast Guard facility in Staten Island as a potential site to hold people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is unclear whether the agents have determined that the Coast Guard facility, Fort Wadsworth, is an acceptable site to hold detainees, or if they are continuing to search for other locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The site is not suitable to house migrants,” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said. “We’ve made this very clear, both publicly and privately, and we do not anticipate any such plans.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Fort Wadsworth, which overlooks the New York Bay, is one of the oldest military sites in the United States and only a 30-minute drive from 26 Federal Plaza, where most immigrants in the city are processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the base is selected, many immigrants from the city will no longer be transported to jails or detention facilities in New Jersey, upstate New York or Pennsylvania. Instead, the increased housing would allow ICE to hold detainees in the city.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2023, the Biden administration, Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul also explored the site as a shelter for asylum seekers entering through New York City, but the plan never came to fruition.\n",

        "November 17, 2025\n",
        "\n",
        "Courtesy of Quinn van Mourik-Rudnick Virginia Gov-Elect Abigail Spanberger speaks at a rally on November 2nd.\n",
        "\n",
        "Students from New Jersey, New York City, Virginia and California said the results of recent elections in their home states signal a nationwide rebuke of President Donald Trump’s second term in office.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple Democratic candidates, including Virginia Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, took home large margins against Republican and independent challengers this month, while a Democratic-backed California ballot initiative to redraw the state’s House of Representatives map won by more than seven million votes. Students from the three states and New York City said the elections signal voters’ dissatisfaction 10 months into Trump’s second term as the president’s approval rating stooped to its lowest point last week since he reentered office.\n",
        "\n",
        "In New Jersey, Sherrill won against former Republican Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, earning about 1.8 million votes compared to Ciattarelli‘s 1.4 million votes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Erin Coughlin, a sophomore studying political science from New Jersey, said her main priority in the election was affordability. She said with rising housing prices and the cost of living in the state, she looked for a candidate whose policies would allow her to eventually buy a house and live in her home state sometime after she graduates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polling from the election showed that Americans were mostly concerned about the economy as an affordability crisis has sparked the president to plan a nationwide tour emphasizing his proposals to improve the cost of living in America.\n",
        "\n",
        "She said education was a “pertinent” issue she looked at during the election cycle, hoping for increased funding and resources for New Jersey public schools, universities and community colleges.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was definitely very surprised at how decisive her victory was,” Coughlin said of Sherrill. “But I wouldn’t say I was entirely shocked that she came out the winner.”\n",
        "\n",
        "John Tober, a sophomore and the director of political affairs for GW College Republicans, said he helped Ciattarelli’s campaign throughout the summer and the fall, including canvassing in the state and phone banking. College Republicans organized phone banking for Ciattarelli in the weeks leading up to the election.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tober said affordability was his main concern in the election, something he said fellow New Jerseyans agreed on when he was out canvassing for Ciattarelli.\n",
        "\n",
        "He said many New Jersey residents prefer to elect a moderate Republican governor, like Ciattarelli or Chris Christie — the state’s governor from 2010 to 2018. He added that Sherrill’s win will keep Democrats in charge of the state for 12 years, limiting the partisan diversity of leadership in the governor‘s office.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You need to have some change, a little diversity in how you handle issues because one party isn‘t going to solve everything perfectly, and that‘s why we have different parties in power all the time, on a state level, on a federal level,” Tober said. “So I just worry about those years of one-party rule, and I think the people of New Jersey are going to suffer for that.”\n",
        "\n",
        "In Virginia, Spanberger, a former Democratic member of the House of Representatives, took home more than 57 percent of the vote in a race pollsters expected her to win against the commonwealth’s Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logan Olszewski, a junior and chief of staff for the GW College Democrats, said the group organized four canvassing trips to Virginia for Spanberger, with a total of about 150 students showing up over four weekends.\n",
        "\n",
        "He said College Democrats feels the growing student participation in canvassing signals heightened student interest in civic involvement and gives him hope that there will be greater civic engagement from the GW student body in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think it gave me, personally, and a lot of people on our board and our membership, a lot of hope that things can get better,” he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Luke Davila, a sophomore from Virginia majoring in political science, attributed the Democratic wins to a general frustration with the Trump administration’s economic policies. He said affordability was the most crucial issue of the election for him because of price increases in basic necessities, which he believes Democrats can best address at the state level.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think Americans are having to go without basic necessities more and more,” Davila said in a text message. “Ever since COVID, the world as a whole has had a tough time recovering, and the US is no exception.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He said the Democratic Party has strong potential to achieve sweeping wins in the 2026 midterms and potentially even the 2028 presidential election, as long as the Democrats who prevailed earlier this month make good on their campaign promises once in office, and the American people remain unhappy with how Trump is handling the economy.\n",
        "\n",
        "“If the Trump Administration keeps frustrating the American people, then I see excellent results coming for the Democrats in the future,” Davila said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani, the Democratic Socialist candidate running as a Democrat, won 50.4 percent of the votes in New York City, beating Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and former Governor Andrew Cuomo — who ran as an independent after losing the Democratic primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sofia Alves, a first-year international affairs student from Manhattan, said gentrification and housing costs were crucial issues for her this election. She said she’s seen families have to leave their homes around her neighborhood due to affordability issues, including Harlem, a neighborhood near her.\n",
        "\n",
        "She said she saw Mamdani’s victory as a sign that candidates who prioritize basic needs and social equity can succeed.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Honestly, this was kind of a big signal of hope,” Alves said. “There was a huge blue wave.”\n",
        "\n",
        "In California, voters overwhelmingly backed a ballot initiative that would redraw the state’s Congressional districts, aiming to help Democrats gain five seats in the House — a response to redistricting efforts in red states intended to favor Republicans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sarah Gohres, a junior majoring in political communications from the Bay Area, said the widespread approval for the proposition in California showed solidarity in the leadership and decision making of the Democratic Party, at a time when she said the party has been “struggling” to have a central platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think opposition to Trump has been struggling because all Democrats have been running on for the past decade is anti-Trump instead of having their own platform,” Gohres said in a text message. “If you ask 10 people what the Democrats want policy-wise you’d get 10 different answers.”\n",
        "\n",
        "She said Proposition 50 was the first “concrete offensive” move Democrats made against the Trump administration since the start of his second term amid a wave of redistricting efforts in Republican states.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Texas and other red states drew blatantly partisan maps, and they were going to see how far they could go without pushback,” Gohres said. “California also choosing to hold an election gave credibility to redraw the maps in a more democratic manner, by actually giving voters the choice.”\n",

        "A stretch of Roosevelt Avenue in Queens is known as the Avenue of 100 Languages. On this road, which crosses two of the most diverse neighborhoods - Jackson Heights and Elmhurst - in the most diverse county in the United States, the accents and customs of more than a hundred countries converge. Here, Colombian arepas are eaten for breakfast and Indian curries for dinner, business signs begin in one language and end in another, and on a cold November morning, the rhythm of a Mexican cumbia playing over the loudspeaker of a food truck parked near the 74th Street subway stop mixes with the conversation of a Nepalese couple strolling down the sidewalk.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "It's been a week since Democrat Zohran Mamdani's historic victory for mayor of New York. In the restaurants and stores surrounding the so-called Diversity Plaza, where Roosevelt Avenue intersects Broadway in the so-called \"district of the world,\" posters with the mayor-elect's face still hang. From the window of one of those stores, next to a poster of \"Bangladeshi Americans for Mamdani\", between a few words in Bengali and some English, a salesman recalls that Mamdani was here a few days before the elections last November 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was the night of October 30. The young Democratic Party socialist (34 years old) arrived at Diversity Plaza around midnight, after chatting with cab drivers at La Guardia airport and visiting night-shift health care workers at an Elmhurst hospital. He dined at one of his favorite kebab restaurants on the corner of the square before holding a press conference surrounded by supporters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani made areas like this in Queens a centerpiece of his mayoral campaign. Not only because he resides in the district, but because he is aware that many of the issues that dominated his race - diversity and migrant communities, the working class and \"affordability\" in a city with skyrocketing costs of living - converge in neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, Elmhurst or Corona.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just hours after his electoral triumph, which he celebrated in Brooklyn, the politician was back in Queens. He met with members of his transition team under the Unisphere, a 32-meter-high stainless steel globe built for the 1964 World's Fair, which was held in the Corona neighborhood. Today, the structure is one of the most recognizable symbols of Queens. Mamdani said he chose the site for his first press conference as mayor-elect because it symbolized his pride in the borough. He then returned to Jackson Heights to have lunch at a Nepalese restaurant with New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n",
        "\n",
        "When he takes office on Jan. 1, Mamdani, born in Uganda to Indian parents and a U.S. citizen since 2018, will break more than one precedent. He will be the first New York mayor resident of Queens, the first to have already represented the borough in public office (he was a member of the State Assembly in Albany) and the first Muslim alderman in the city's history. He will also be the first immigrant to hold the post in nearly half a century.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Shekar Krishnan, a member of the New York City Council, whose district includes three of the neighborhoods that Roosevelt Avenue crosses, it is impossible to understand Mamdani's victory without first understanding the cultural richness of Queens. \"And you can't tell the story of Queens without telling the story of Jackson Heights,\" he notes by phone from City Hall.\n",
        "\n",
        "In New York, about 35% of its 8.5 million residents are migrants. In Queens, however, that percentage rises to nearly 50% of a total of 2.3 million. And in neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, the immigrant-origin population exceeds 60%. Mamdani won here, as well as in parts of Elmhurst and Corona, two other neighborhoods where more than half the population is migrant.\n",
        "\n",
        "More than 300 languages are spoken in the district, and a third of them coexist on Roosevelt Avenue, according to the Alliance for Endangered Languages. In a stretch of about twenty blocks between Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Corona, you can go around the world without leaving New York: you can hear Bengali, Nepali, Spanish, Punjabi, Tibetan, Urdu, Greek...\n",
        "\n",
        "Krishnan says of Mamdani's win, whom he has known for years, \"[It] was a statement of our values as a city, an affirmation of the importance of immigrant communities.\" \"His election illustrates how New Yorkers are united in both their desire for a more affordable city and their desire for us to embrace and celebrate our diversity,\" he says.\n",
        "\n",
        "Krishnan was the first Indo-American elected to the City Council in New York's history. He coincided with Mamdani in 2021 in a cab driver walkout in which the now mayor-elect participated in a 15-day hunger strike alongside hundreds of drivers protesting the debts they were carrying after being subjected to abusive credit practices to pay for their licenses. Both were arrested during the protests, which culminated when the city agreed to a program that forgave millions of dollars in debt.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I was drawn into that fight with Zohran precisely because we were fighting for our community,\" Krishnan recalls. Many of those cab drivers were migrants and Queens residents, and they joined Mamdani's campaign four years later.\n",
        "\n",
        "Trump's cradle\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, as mayor of New York, Mamdani will position himself at the forefront of the Democratic resistance against Donald Trump. The Republican president has threatened to cut the city's federal funding in response to the socialist's victory and has considered sending National Guard troops, as he has already done in other Democratic cities such as Los Angeles, to enforce his immigration agenda. Mamdani, for his part, has made it clear that he will not be intimidated. In his election night victory speech, he addressed the president directly, asked him to turn up the volume on his television to make sure he could hear him, and declared, \"New York will remain a city of immigrants, built by immigrants and driven by immigrants. And, as of tonight, led by an immigrant.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "His will be the battle of the two Queens, because Mamdani's or Krishnan's Queens - the immigrant heart of the city - is also the birthplace of Donald Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "The president was born here. In fact, his ties to the borough go back to the turn of the last century. His paternal grandparents, German immigrants, settled in Woodhaven, Queens, in the early 1900s. The incumbent was born in the borough of Jamaica and grew up in the adjacent affluent Jamaica Estates area, just over 10 kilometers but worlds away from places like Jackson Heights or Elmhurst, which by those years were already known for their growing diversity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 2024 presidential election, the Republican won significant support in both neighborhoods, as well as in other areas of Queens with high migrant populations. Although the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, won New York State, she did so by a notably smaller margin than Joe Biden did in 2020. In Elmhurst and Corona, support for the Democrats was then down 40%.\n",
        "\n",
        "A year later, the vast majority of those same areas voted overwhelmingly for Mamdani. Although independent candidate and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo - whom the president endorsed a few days before the vote - generally did better among Trump voters, Mamdani managed to win back many migrant-majority areas in Queens.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Jason Antos, a historian of the district, it's not a difficult paradox to understand. \"It's very Queens,\" he says. The also director of the Corona-based Queens Historical Society argues that \"a lot of the reasons people voted for Trump are the same reasons they voted for Mamdani,\" starting with the high cost of living.\n",
        "\n",
        "Antos explains that the district has always been a destination for migrants, even since colonial times, when Europeans of various nationalities arrived attracted by the cheap soil, which was also ideal for agriculture. Today, the diversity of the borough, in which \"every country, even the smallest, is represented to some degree,\" is due in part to the fact that it remained for years a more affordable place to live than Manhattan or Brooklyn. Many migrant communities displaced by the city's gentrification have ended up in neighborhoods like Jackson Heights.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's a reality that, however, has been changing \"over the last 20 years,\" according to the historian. Rents and the cost of living have risen steadily in Queens, as they have in the rest of New York City. This issue was a focus of both Trump's 2024 and Mamdani's 2025 campaigns. And it was also the key issue in the victories of both.\n",
        "\n",
        "State Assemblywoman Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, whose district includes Jackson Heights, says Mamdani won in these migrant-majority areas that supported Trump because he understood voters' concerns. \"Zohran really listened to the community, especially after the 2024 election. What he heard from them was that they were fed up with the politics of the past and were looking for something different. And the affordability issue was something that really resonated,\" he says by phone from Albany.\n",
        "\n",
        "González-Rojas made it to the State Assembly in 2021 alongside Mamdani, becoming the first Latina, of Puerto Rican and Paraguayan roots, to be voted in to represent her district. She has known the mayor-elect for years and endorsed his candidacy for City Council. She is confident that Mamdani's will be an administration that reflects the contradictions of neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, which in the end can also be seen as a mirror of the United States: a country increasingly of migrant origin, struggling to make ends meet and looking for an alternative to \"politics as usual.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "The New York City Council unanimously approved a rezoning on Wednesday that could transform an industrial stretch of Queens into thousands of apartments -- private development aimed at addressing the city's affordable housing crisis.\n",

        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "The vote comes a little over a week after the mayoral election, in which housing was a top issue for voters and Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani cruised to victory on a platform of affordability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under the plan, developers could build nearly 15,000 apartments within 54 blocks of Long Island City that are currently filled with warehouses and parking lots. Seven years ago, left-leaning politicians opposed a plan that would have given incentives to Amazon to build a headquarters in the same neighborhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "The new plan, with its focus on housing and community amenities instead of huge public subsidies for a wealthy company like Amazon, has earned the support of the local councilwoman, Julie Won, and other politicians who did not want the headquarters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The proposal includes hundreds of millions of dollars for parks, public housing, schools, sewers and more. About 30 percent of the housing must be affordable to people of lower or moderate incomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "''We are fully aware that New York City is in an affordable housing crisis and a housing crisis at large,'' Ms. Won said on Wednesday. ''Long Island City -- we will continue to be a leader in the production of new housing.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani, whose assembly district includes parts of the rezoning area, said in a statement on Wednesday that the plan was a ''victory for Long Island City residents.''\n",
        "\n",
        "City officials have increasingly come to see neighborhood-specific development proposals as valuable ways to confront a housing shortage that is at its worst point in nearly 60 years. The city has approved plans in Midtown Manhattan, the east Bronx, Jamaica in Queens, SoHo in Manhattan and Gowanus in Brooklyn in recent years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Few parts of New York reflect its housing conundrum as vividly as Long Island City.\n",
        "\n",
        "The neighborhood's proximity to Manhattan office buildings and access to several subway lines have made it a hotbed of luxury development and a symbol of gentrification. Some 28,000 homes have been built in the surrounding area over the past decade and a half, according to the Department of City Planning. The typical asking rent is more than $4,500 a month.\n",
        "\n",
        "Still, many of the blocks in the rezoning area have remained cut off from residential development because they are zoned for manufacturing uses, a relic of the neighborhood's industrial past.\n",
        "\n",
        "Those blocks have long been an alluring site for development; there have been at least five failed attempts to build on portions of the area since 2015, including the Amazon deal.\n",
        "\n",
        "The new proposal's approval on Wednesday represents a shift in the political calculus.\n",
        "\n",
        "''The approval of this plan opens the door for more New Yorkers of all income levels to live and work here -- and to benefit from new open space and community investments,'' said Dan Garodnick, the chair of the City Planning Commission and the director of the Planning Department, which helped shape the plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the supportive comments of Ms. Won, Mr. Mamdani and other left-leaning politicians, the plan still generated opposition from community members.\n",

        "Zohran Mamdani's stunning victory in the New York City mayoral race last week marked not merely a shift in political leadership, but also the emergence of a new class coalition -- one defined less by ideology and identity, than by a shared experience of economic squeeze. The coalition that carried the 34-year-old political newcomer to power was multiracial, cross-class and geographically broad.\n",
        "\n",
        "But at its core was a group that political science has long struggled to categorise: the downwardly mobile professional class. Or, what some have dubbed as the \"struggling yuppie\" voters who propelled Mamdani, a self-described socialist, to power in the capital of capitalism.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "Their rise to central political relevance in cities such as New York reveals deep structural transformations in advanced urban economies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani's triumph was not an accident. It reflected a profound shift in New York City's political economy -- one in which renters, not homeowners; downwardly mobile professionals, not affluent elites; and multiracial working-class communities, not traditionally mobilised blocs; defined the new electoral majority. His campaign recognised and synthesised this emerging alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Renters \"for life\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Across the city, Black, Latino and Asian-American renters spend 40 to 55 per cent of income on rent, escalating eviction pressures and aggressive gentrification.\n",
        "\n",
        "These communities responded strongly to Mamdani's universal rent freeze, tenant-first protections, public housing expansion and fare-free buses. These were not abstract ideological promises -- they were cost-of-living lifelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simultaneously, people from working-class districts who had been priced out of their own neighbourhoods saw Mamdani's housing platform as the first credible plan in years to halt displacement. The alignment of material interests across racial lines produced a rare moment of cross-ethnic solidarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most unexpected driver of Mamdani's landslide win came from a group often assumed to be stable, liberal and affluent: the credentialed professional class earning between US$80,000 and US$150,000 a year.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite seemingly high incomes, they face structural economic immobility: rents consuming 35 to 50 per cent of their income; US$25,000 to US$50,000 annual childcare bills; student loans that never quite disappear; stagnant career ladders in sectors such as journalism, media, non-profits, arts, academia and healthcare; and the near-impossible dream of owning a home.\n",
        "\n",
        "These voters -- mainly in their late 20s to early 40s -- turned out in staggering numbers in Astoria, Park Slope, Clinton Hill, Williamsburg, Fort Greene, and the gentrified zones of Queens and Brooklyn.\n",
        "\n",
        "They were the campaign's financial lifeblood and provided most of its volunteers, organisers, canvassers and media amplification. Voters under 40 -- the most rent-burdened age cohort -- voted at levels unseen in previous cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The rise of the downwardly mobile professionals\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand the coalition that propelled Mamdani, we must examine the group at its core -- the downwardly mobile professional class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Their sociological distinctiveness makes them a new political subject.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are not the old industrial working class, nor the traditional middle class of the post-war period. Instead, they are highly educated, culturally liberal, but economically trapped.\n",
        "\n",
        "They share several traits:\n",
        "\n",
        "This class feels that they \"did everything right\" -- worked hard, earned their degrees, built careers -- but were denied the stability previous generations enjoyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This yields anger, alienation and a search for alternative political narratives. They see the city not as a community, but as a luxury product engineered for global capital, tourists and developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite lacking wealth, they are extremely rich in cultural capital -- media literacy, organisational skills, networks and political awareness.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes them particularly potent political actors: they can tell compelling stories, organise quickly, and amplify issues across digital and cultural platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Though not numerically dominant, they loom large in journalism, universities, non-profits, cultural institutions and tech. As a result, their anxieties rapidly become citywide discourse. This magnifies their political significance far beyond raw numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani's campaign explicitly addressed their concerns. To them, he offered the first blueprint for a liveable future within the city.\n",
        "\n",
        "They did not vote out of ideological socialism -- they voted out of survival.\n",
        "\n",
        "A new urban class politics\n",
        "\n",
        "The downwardly mobile professionals are becoming a new, distinct class: well-educated, culturally progressive, but economically fragile. This group is neither fully working class, nor truly middle class -- it is a hybrid class forged by structural urban pressures.\n",
        "\n",
        "The structural drivers are long term: persistent elite overproduction, sky-high rents and minimal housing supply, childcare costs outpacing wages, labour markets hostile to mid-career mobility, asset appreciation benefiting older cohorts, and inflation in urban services.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is not a temporary phenomenon -- it is the new urban majority.\n",
        "\n",
        "This phenomenon is not unique to New York, though a Mamdani victory may be hard to replicate in other parts of the US. Similar structural forces are at play in other advanced urban economies.\n",

        "Congratulations to Zohran Mamdani, who has become the mayor-elect of New York after a stunningly effective campaign. He began it with little name recognition, let alone support, and captured New Yorkers' attention with a joyful, social-media-driven campaign that focused on the city's onerous cost of living. After winning the Democratic primary in June, he reached out to critics and displayed a pragmatic streak. From beginning to end, he outcompeted New York's tired political establishment, vanquishing technocrats with more experience as well as the incumbent mayor and a former governor. On Tuesday Mr. Mamdani won a comfortable victory.\n",

        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "This board did not support his primary campaign, owing to our concerns about his policy proposals and his inexperience. But we are rooting for his success. New York -- the world's most dynamic city, but one where many residents feel priced out of a good life -- needs him to succeed. The city's direction is especially important now, when President Trump is flouting the law to consolidate power and falsely casting the country's biggest cities as out of control. He has already begun to treat Mr. Mamdani as a foil.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Mr. Mamdani to be effective, he will need to grapple with the recent history of big-city civic leaders promising bold, progressive change. They have mostly delivered disappointment, including in Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Ore., as well as in New York City itself under Bill de Blasio. They have tolerated a level of disorder that many voters found unacceptable and struggled to make progress on affordability or K-12 schools. Mr. de Blasio had one major success that Mr. Mamdani justly cites as an inspiration: universal pre-K, which has helped hundreds of thousands of children. Still, Mr. de Blasio's overall record made him so unpopular that he could not win the Democratic nomination for a House district in Brooklyn after he left office.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani, who campaigned on sweeping promises, can build a more positive legacy by focusing on tangible accomplishments. He should take notes from successful mayors, moderate and progressive alike, including Muriel Bowser of Washington, Mike Duggan of Detroit and Michelle Wu of Boston, who have delivered concrete solutions to specific problems. Mr. Mamdani cannot solve economic inequality, the problem that fueled his campaign. But he can make progress. He can build more housing. He can expand the availability of child care and good schools. He can improve bus and subway speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "If he succeeds, he will offer a model of Democratic Party governance at a time when many Americans are skeptical of the party and have departed Democratic-run states for Republican-run ones. Across U.S. history, political progressives have a proud record of using government to ameliorate extreme inequality and enabling more Americans to live well. Mr. Mamdani has an opportunity to write the next chapter in that story.\n",
        "\n",
        "In almost every area that featured prominently in the mayoral campaign, Mr. Mamdani can improve life in New York by marrying his admirable ambition to pragmatism and compromise. We will focus on six areas, and offer a yardstick for each.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Housing\n",
        "\n",
        "The cost of housing is a defining problem of New York life. The city faces an affordability crisis mostly because its political leaders have sharply limited construction since the 1960s. They have made it difficult to replace existing buildings with larger ones in a misguided effort to preserve communities. The effect has been gentrification. Constricted supply has led to higher prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Until recently, Mr. Mamdani seemed determined to ignore the government's role. He blamed landlords and developers and argued for more stringent rent stabilization, which does nothing to help people who do not already live in stabilized apartments. But housing is one of the areas in which he has demonstrated a willingness to listen.\n",
        "\n",
        "In his campaign, Mr. Mamdani said that he had changed his mind about the need for more private development. That is vital because private developers have far more capacity to expand the housing stock than the government. He can make a difference by backing a bolder version of Mayor Eric Adams's City of Yes plan, allowing denser development around transit stations and reducing requirements for elevators, among other things.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani is correct that the government also has a crucial role in subsidizing housing for lower-income New Yorkers, and he has proposed the construction of 200,000 rent-stabilized housing units. The plan faces obstacles, but the goal is a good one.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: Experts estimate that New York needs about half a million new homes over the next decade, so a good measure of Mr. Mamdani's performance will be whether the number of units under construction climbs toward 50,000 a year.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Transportation\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani has pledged to make buses both free and faster. Of the two goals, speed is more important.\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster buses -- and subways -- would help almost all New Yorkers, especially those who commute longer distances. Today, local buses travel at an average speed of just eight miles per hour. A dedicated bus lane on 14th Street in Manhattan has shown that improvement is possible, leading to faster speeds, fewer crashes and more riders. (Unfortunately, the Trump administration has halted a similar plan for 34th Street.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani's plan for free buses would obviously reduce costs for many New Yorkers, but it would leave the system without the revenue it needs to pay for speed improvements. Free buses could also reduce the sense of security for riders, turning buses into homeless shelters. Trying to wish away trade-offs like these is one of the mistakes that progressive leaders elsewhere have made.\n",
        "\n",
        "A better idea, championed by transportation planners, would enact a reduced fare for all riders on major bus routes, particularly those used by low-income riders. If Mr. Mamdani and Gov. Kathy Hochul can work together to make this happen, they would speed commutes and persuade more riders to use the transit system rather than cars.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: Mr. Mamdani should aspire to raise average bus speeds to 10 miles per hour -- a failed pledge of Mr. de Blasio's -- and average subway speeds closer to 20 miles per hour than the current 17.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Child care\n",
        "\n",
        "Typical New York families with young children today pay more than one quarter of their incomes for child care, leaving too little money for everything else. Mr. Mamdani has promised to deliver free, universal child care starting at 6 weeks old. It is a worthy goal. Decades of evidence have made clear that high-quality child care is a good investment, for both children's development and parents' ability to work.\n",
        "\n",
        "He is unlikely to achieve this goal in full, given its costs and the lack of an obvious revenue source. He favors tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, which Ms. Hochul opposes. Still, it would be a signature accomplishment if he could fix the many problems with the current preschool system for 3-year-olds, including the long distances some families must travel to claim open spots, and begin to create a universal care program for 2-year-olds.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: Only about two-thirds as many children are enrolled in the program for 3-year-olds as are in the one for 4-year-olds. By the end of 2027, all 3-year-olds should be able to enroll in a class convenient to their homes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Public safety\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though crime has fallen over the past couple of years, polls show that many New Yorkers remain concerned about it. Their worries are legitimate. Crime is still considerably higher than it was before the Covid-19 pandemic began. The rate of major felonies -- a category that includes car thefts, burglaries, felony assaults, rape and murder -- is on pace to be about 25 percent higher this year than it was in 2019.\n",
        "\n",
        "The past few decades have offered strong evidence about how to reduce crime, including lower-level crimes that foster a sense of disorder. The solution involves substantial policing, with officers who know the communities they patrol. Yet New York employs almost 3,000 fewer police officers than it did pre-Covid, a decline of 8 percent. Fortunately, Mr. Mamdani has stopped using the anti-police rhetoric he once did, and said he would ask Jessica Tisch, the current commissioner, to stay in the job. She has presided over crime declines this year and wants to hire more officers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani continues to favor alternatives to police officers in certain situations, such as encounters with mentally ill people. Some of these ideas have shown promising results elsewhere, although they typically require collaboration between social-services workers and police officers, given the safety risks. Ultimately, New York should pursue an all-of-the-above approach that combines more officers and alternatives when feasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: Major crime should return to the levels of the late 2010s, if not lower. That would require a decline of about 25,000 major felonies relative to the current annual level.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Education\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani has given less attention to education policy than he has to some other areas. He has even proposed that the mayor give up control of the city's schools and decentralize authority to teachers and parents. That would be a mistake. The K-12 school system, like early child care, is crucial to the city's future. And the most successful models of educational progress have depended on a strong central authority.\n",
        "\n",
        "Children in Mississippi and Louisiana, for example, have made exciting recent gains in reading thanks to statewide policies that combine teacher training and high standards; most students there cannot advance to fourth grade without meeting a literacy minimum. Chicago outpaced other big cities in the 2010s with a top-down model in which the city held principals accountable for their students' academic progress. There are no similarly inspiring stories involving cities where mayors ignored the schools.\n",
        "\n",
        "We hope Mr. Mamdani uses the power he will soon have to improve the nation's largest school district. He should be careful not to get bogged down by divisive issues -- such as the future of relatively small gifted and talented programs -- and focus on the programs that educate the most children.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: Only 29 percent of eighth graders in New York are proficient at reading and only 23 percent are proficient in math, according to federal data. That is roughly average for a large U.S. city. It is also unacceptable. Both numbers should rise substantially under the Mamdani administration.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Jobs\n",
        "\n",
        "Many business leaders are wary of Mr. Mamdani, if not outright alarmed, because of his embrace of socialism. But some executives who have met with Mr. Mamdani since his primary win have emerged hopeful. Both he and they should recognize that they have a common interest in the city's well-being and in preserving its status as a hub of business and finance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani's No. 1 promise is to make New York more affordable for residents. He should extend that goal to the city's small businesses, which also are struggling. Prime targets include simplifying regulations and making better use of tax policy to support small businesses. One example: Landlords should have an incentive to offer longer leases to independent businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: More businesses have closed than opened in recent quarters. Mr. Mamdani should set a goal of increasing the number of businesses operating in New York by 10 percent during his first term.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani will take office on Jan. 1, 2026, with a reservoir of good will. He inspires young people who are cynical about politics. He will be the city's first Muslim mayor, its youngest mayor in more than a century and its first immigrant mayor since the 1970s.\n",
        "\n",
        "But the reasons that many New Yorkers are skeptical of him also deserve to be taken seriously. He had almost no management experience before his campaign, and extreme rhetoric was his normal mode of communication until recently. He called the New York Police Department ''a major threat to public safety.'' He initially refused to condemn Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel. To this day, he proudly identifies with the Democratic Socialists of America, whose platform supports open borders, voting access for noncitizens and a weaker U.S. military.\n",
        "\n",
        "He can win at least some of his skeptics over by getting results as mayor. He should start by building a leadership team light on democratic socialists and heavy on officials with records of accomplishment and proven management skills. He should then remain laser-focused on tangible improvements to city life. If he can build a more affordable city where New Yorkers feel as safe as they did in the early 2010s, where the subways and buses move more quickly, where both schools and early child care improve and where good-paying jobs are plentiful, he will have a claim on being one of the city's great mayors.\n",

        "Irvan Maulana , Jakarta\n",
        "\n",
        "The struggle over a city is, at its core, a struggle over the price of space, over who gets to stay, who is pushed out and who benefits from rising land values. Zohran Mamdani's victory as mayor of New York City, in the United States, brings this issue back to the center of public debate.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "He rejects the assumption that rising rents, gentrification and displacement are natural outcomes of urban growth. For him, these patterns, visible in nearly every major city, including Jakarta, stem from the political configuration of urban land: how it is allocated, who is prioritized and who bears the cost of development.\n",
        "\n",
        "The significance of Mamdani's leadership does not lie in the symbolic fact that he is the first Muslim to hold the office, nor in his ability to galvanize young voters. What sets him apart is the way he reframes a basic premise rarely questioned in mainstream urban policy: The high cost of living in cities is not the result of neutral market dynamics. It comes from power structures that privilege landowners and property capital.\n",
        "\n",
        "This view is central to his proposal for a rent freeze. Mamdani does not present rent freezing as an ultimate solution. It is an intervention to slow down rent escalation that consistently outpaces the income growth of residents. The freeze applies to existing rent-stabilized units rather than new developments, meaning it does not interfere with housing construction or discourage developers from adding new supply.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to prevent forced displacement, the mechanism through which gentrification begins. The freeze acts as a social stabilizer, protecting long-term residents from being priced out of neighborhoods whose rising land values they had no part in shaping.\n",
        "\n",
        "In many major cities, rent increases are driven not by improvements in public services or neighborhood quality, but by speculation and concentrated land ownership. A rent freeze provides a pause in this dynamic, ensuring that those who already live in the city are not pushed out simply because the land beneath them becomes more profitable for someone else.\n",
        "\n",
        "Critics often invoke the memory of New York's 1970s fiscal crisis, when declining tax revenues and suburban flight left the city unable to service its debts. The Emergency Financial Control Board responded by cutting public services and allowing urban decay to spread. From that moment, state intervention became associated with inefficiency and fiscal burden.\n",
        "\n",
        "But today's context is different. The dominant force shaping cities is not an overextended state, but the market's power to determine the price of space, through land concentration, speculative holding and the financialization of housing. Mamdani operates in this terrain. His approach seeks to correct power imbalances, not recreate past state overreach.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this framework, gentrification is not a natural step in urban evolution. It is the result of institutional decisions about who has access to land, credit and planning approvals. Landlords, developers and financial institutions hold bargaining power far above that of the people who live and work in the city. Many residents lose the ability to remain in the very neighborhoods they helped shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani challenges what might be called the rentier logic: the expectation that wealth should grow simply by owning space, without productive contribution. In global cities, including Jakarta, land prices often rise not because the area becomes more livable, but because speculative expectations are reinforced by policy and capital flows.\n",
        "\n",
        "His earlier political work illustrates this approach. As a state assembly member representing Queens, he pushed for Good Cause Eviction, legislation that limits a landlord's capacity to evict tenants without a valid reason. Through legislative advocacy and grassroots organizing with apartment renters, Mamdani built a political model grounded in everyday urban experience. His work addresses more than tenant rights; it questions the structural power that treats urban space as an endlessly extractable asset.\n",
        "\n",
        "This aligns with the dual-track housing approach used in cities such as Vienna, Berlin, Singapore and Paris. These cities maintain affordability by separating the social function of housing from its market function. Public or city-run housing serves as a stabilizing layer, ensuring that residents can remain in the city even when private market prices rise. Meanwhile, the market continues to exist, innovate and build, but it does not define who gets to stay in the city.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani's victory matters for developing countries like Indonesia not because it comes from a major global city, but because it shifts how we interpret urban land prices. If New York, a city long considered the model of global real estate capitalism, now openly acknowledges that urban affordability is shaped by political decisions, then it becomes harder to insist that rising housing costs in Jakarta, Bandung, Makassar or Surabaya are natural, inevitable or beyond intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Indonesia, housing policy focuses heavily on subsidized mortgages and affordable unit programs, FLPP, Tapera and others. But all of these operate after land prices are already set by the market. The state supports people in purchasing homes, yet it does little to shape the price of land itself. As a result, every increase in housing subsidy risks being absorbed upward into land prices. The capacity to pay is strengthened, but the affordability of land is not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cities expand, but residents are pushed further to the periphery. Commuting burdens intensify. Daily life becomes more fragmented. The city grows, while its people grow distant from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani's contribution is to remind us that the price of urban space is not a neutral economic outcome. It is the result of choices. Policies determine ownership patterns, development incentives and who the city ultimately serves.\n",
        "\n",
        "Housing, therefore, is not merely an economic issue. It is a political one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Urban space is shaped, consciously or not, around assumptions of who belongs. Mamdani asks us to reconsider that foundation. His message is clear: The high cost of urban living is not a permanent condition. It is a policy outcome. And outcomes can be changed.\n",

The coordination between modern campaign strategy and promises aimed at the working class has resulted in a winning combination - although it is unclear whether the 34-year-old politician's plans will all be possible to implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Democrat, who defined himself as a \"democratic socialist\" during the campaign, based his candidacy on four central proposals: the guarantee of universal access to daycare centers; the right to free buses; the creation of municipal supermarkets; and the freezing of rent prices. It is estimated that the cost of the proposals, if they are actually implemented, will amount to approximately US$7 billion (R$37.6 billion at the current exchange rate) per year.\n",

        "Mamdani's opponents on the ballot - former New York governor Andrew Cuomo (a Democrat who ran as an independent) and Republican Curtis Sliwa - have attacked the projects, accusing them of being incompatible with city spending. Although the amount for implementation is higher than the annual spending on the New York Police Department (US$6.8 billion), which is the largest in the world, Mamdani said during the campaign that the budget of almost US$116 billion has room for the measures, if treated as priorities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani wants to raise US$9 billion in new revenue by increasing the income tax for wealthy New York residents and the corporate tax - a controversial proposal that would require the support of state legislators. He also wants to simplify city contracts, hire more auditors to oversee the tax code and collect more in fines - three measures he says could generate an additional US$1 billion a year. These changes would probably need the support of the City Council (equivalent to the Chambers of Aldermen in Brazil) as part of the budget process.\n",

Mamdani's proposal aims to expand access to daycare for babies and children under the age of 3, covering the age range from 6 weeks to 5 years. The measure is the most ambitious and expensive - the Democrat's own campaign estimated its cost at US$ 6 billion. The amount would include the creation of new daycare centers and the hiring of professionals in various fields.\n",
        "\n",

        "Free buses\n",

        "Mamdani's proposal aims to expand a pilot program adopted at the time of the pandemic, which would eliminate fares on all buses in the city. The estimated value of the project is US$800 million annually. The plan also includes the expansion of exclusive bus lanes in order to speed up traffic and make it easier for the thousands of daily users of the service to get around.\n",

        "The project would also be funded by increasing the state tax rate on companies and the income tax on people with an income of more than US$1 million a year - R$5.4 million - which, in the case of tax matters, requires state approval. However, even if it finds another form of financing, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is responsible for operating the bus network and would need to rule on the project, which would require another negotiation at state level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Municipal supermarkets\n",
        "\n",
        "A central proposal in the Democrat's campaign, in response to the rising cost of living in the city, would be the creation of five government-subsidized supermarkets, one in each district of the city. The idea is to launch the five markets as part of a pilot plan and expand it if it succeeds in reducing the population's spending on food. The estimate is that they will spend US$ 60 million a year.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pilot program is not as expensive as the other proposals, but it would have to be discussed with the City Council to be included in the public budget. The city would probably cover the costs of rent, utilities and property taxes, and the supermarkets could buy and sell goods at wholesale prices, using central warehouses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Freezing the price of real estate rents\n",
        "\n",
        "The measure with the lowest cost for New York City Hall is also one of the most controversial from a political point of view. Mamdani has promised to freeze rents on almost a million apartments in order to combat gentrification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Critics of the plan warned that freezing rents would not tackle the real problem: the rapid increase in the prices charged for properties rented out at market prices, outside of any public control. They also argued that the measure would impose new costs on landlords, who are responsible for expenses such as maintaining old buildings and paying the IPTU.\n",
        "\n",
        "To convert the proposal into an effective measure, Mamdani would need to obtain authorization only from the Rent Guidelines Council, made up of nine members appointed by the mayor. The body authorized a similar measure for three years under then Mayor Bill de Blasio. The mayor-elect can appoint people to the board, although the members' terms are staggered, and he may not be able to completely overhaul the board in one fell swoop. (With NYT)\n",

        "Congratulations to Zohran Mamdani, who has become the mayor-elect of New York after a stunningly effective campaign. He began it with little name recognition, let alone support, and captured New Yorkers’ attention with a joyful, social-media-driven campaign [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/magazine/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york.html] that focused on the city’s onerous cost of living. After winning the Democratic primary in June, he reached out to critics and displayed a pragmatic streak. From beginning to end, he outcompeted New York’s tired political establishment, vanquishing technocrats with more experience as well as the incumbent mayor and a former governor. On Tuesday Mr. Mamdani won a comfortable victory.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "This board did not support [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/opinion/new-york-mayor-election-advice.html] his primary campaign, owing to our concerns about his policy proposals and his inexperience. But we are rooting for his success. New York — the world’s most dynamic city, but one where many residents feel priced out of a good life — needs him to succeed. The city’s direction is especially important now, when President Trump is flouting the law to consolidate power [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/opinion/trump-autocracy-democracy-report.html] and falsely casting the country’s biggest cities as out of control. He has already begun to treat Mr. Mamdani as a foil.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Mr. Mamdani to be effective, he will need to grapple with the recent history of big-city civic leaders promising bold, progressive change. They have mostly delivered disappointment, including in Chicago [https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/10/29/mayor-brandon-johnsons-job-approval-tax-agenda-poll], San Francisco [https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/09/san-francisco-london-breed-ouster-00188581], Seattle [https://www.thestranger.com/katie-wilson/2025/01/08/79863479/where-the-left-went-wrong-on-homelessness] and Portland, Ore. [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/15/opinion/progressives-california-portland.html], as well as in New York City itself [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-congress.html] under Bill de Blasio. They have tolerated a level of disorder that many voters found unacceptable and struggled to make progress on affordability or K-12 schools. Mr. de Blasio had one major success that Mr. Mamdani justly cites as an inspiration: universal pre-K [https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/bill-de-blasio-universal-prek-ten-years-later.html], which has helped hundreds of thousands of children. Still, Mr. de Blasio’s overall record made him so unpopular [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-congress.html] that he could not win the Democratic nomination for a House district in Brooklyn after he left office.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani, who campaigned on sweeping promises, can build a more positive legacy by focusing on tangible accomplishments. He should take notes from successful mayors, moderate and progressive alike, including Muriel Bowser of Washington [https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/interactive/2025/dc-mayor-muriel-bowser-legacy-10-year-anniversary/], Mike Duggan of Detroit [https://www.governing.com/magazine/meet-americas-most-effective-mayor-detroits-mike-duggan] and Michelle Wu of Boston [https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/21/newsletters/starting-point-michelle-wu-boston/], who have delivered concrete solutions to specific problems. Mr. Mamdani cannot solve economic inequality, the problem that fueled his campaign. But he can make progress. He can build more housing. He can expand the availability of child care and good schools. He can improve bus and subway speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "If he succeeds, he will offer a model of Democratic Party governance at a time when many Americans are skeptical of the party and have departed [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/08/25/us/politics/electoral-college-seats-republicans-democrats-redistricting.html] Democratic-run states for Republican-run ones. Across U.S. history, political progressives have a proud record of using government to ameliorate extreme inequality and enabling more Americans to live well. Mr. Mamdani has an opportunity to write the next chapter in that story.\n",
        "\n",
        "In almost every area that featured prominently in the mayoral campaign, Mr. Mamdani can improve life in New York by marrying his admirable ambition to pragmatism and compromise. We will focus on six areas, and offer a yardstick for each.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Housing\n",
        "\n",
        "The cost of housing is a defining problem of New York life. The city faces an affordability crisis [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/nyregion/who-can-afford-three-kids-in-new-york-city.html] mostly because its political leaders have sharply limited construction since the 1960s. They have made it difficult to replace existing buildings with larger ones in a misguided effort to preserve communities. The effect has been gentrification. Constricted supply has led to higher prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Until recently, Mr. Mamdani seemed determined to ignore the government’s role. He blamed landlords and developers and argued for more stringent rent stabilization, which does nothing to help people who do not already live in stabilized apartments. But housing is one of the areas in which he has demonstrated a willingness to listen.\n",
        "\n",
        "In his campaign, Mr. Mamdani said that he had changed his mind about the need for more private development. That is vital because private developers have far more capacity to expand the housing stock than the government. He can make a difference by backing a bolder version of Mayor Eric Adams’s City of Yes plan, allowing denser development around transit stations and reducing requirements for elevators [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/opinion/elevator-construction-regulation-labor-immigration.html], among other things.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani is correct that the government also has a crucial role in subsidizing housing for lower-income New Yorkers, and he has proposed the construction [https://www.zohranfornyc.com/policies/housing-by-and-for-new-york] of 200,000 rent-stabilized housing units. The plan faces obstacles, but the goal is a good one.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: Experts estimate that New York needs about half a million new homes over the next decade, so a good measure of Mr. Mamdani’s performance will be whether the number of units under construction climbs toward 50,000 a year.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Transportation\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani has pledged to make buses both free and faster. Of the two goals, speed is more important.\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster buses — and subways — would help almost all New Yorkers, especially those who commute longer distances. Today, local buses travel at an average speed of just eight miles per hour [https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/life-in-the-slow-lane/]. A dedicated bus lane on 14th Street in Manhattan has shown that improvement is possible, leading to faster speeds, fewer crashes and more riders. (Unfortunately, the Trump administration has halted a similar plan [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/nyregion/trump-administration-nyc-bus-34th-st.html] for 34th Street.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani’s plan for free buses would obviously reduce costs for many New Yorkers, but it would leave the system without the revenue it needs to pay for speed improvements. Free buses could also reduce the sense of security for riders, turning buses into homeless shelters. Trying to wish away trade-offs like these is one of the mistakes that progressive leaders elsewhere have made.\n",
        "\n",
        "A better idea, championed [https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/10/07/18-billion-transit-cut-gridlock-sam-schwartz-city-hall-free-for-all-faqnyc-podcast/] by transportation planners, would enact a reduced fare for all riders on major bus routes, particularly those used by low-income riders. If Mr. Mamdani and Gov. Kathy Hochul can work together to make this happen, they would speed commutes and persuade more riders to use the transit system rather than cars.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: Mr. Mamdani should aspire to raise average bus speeds to 10 miles per hour — a failed pledge of Mr. de Blasio’s [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/nyregion/de-blasio-report-card-inequity.html] — and average subway speeds closer to 20 miles per hour than the current 17.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Child care\n",
        "\n",
        "Typical New York families with young children today pay more than one quarter [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/nyregion/child-care-nyc.html] of their incomes for child care, leaving too little money for everything else. Mr. Mamdani has promised to deliver free, universal child care starting at 6 weeks old. It is a worthy goal. Decades of evidence [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/upshot/preschool-child-care-biden.html] have made clear that high-quality child care is a good investment, for both children’s development and parents’ ability to work.\n",
        "\n",
        "He is unlikely to achieve this goal in full, given its costs and the lack of an obvious revenue source. He favors tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, which Ms. Hochul opposes [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/06/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-nyc-policy-proposals.html]. Still, it would be a signature accomplishment if he could fix the many problems with the current preschool system for 3-year-olds, including the long distances some families must travel to claim open spots, and begin to create a universal care program for 2-year-olds.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: Only about two-thirds as many children are enrolled in the program for 3-year-olds as are in the one for 4-year-olds. By the end of 2027, all 3-year-olds should be able to enroll in a class convenient to their homes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Public safety\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though crime has fallen over the past couple of years, polls show that many New Yorkers remain concerned about it. Their worries are legitimate. Crime is still considerably higher than it was before the Covid-19 pandemic began. The rate of major felonies — a category that includes car thefts, burglaries, felony assaults, rape and murder — is on pace to be about 25 percent higher this year than it was in 2019.\n",
        "\n",
        "The past few decades have offered strong evidence about how to reduce crime [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/opinion/crime-statistics-washington-dc.html], including lower-level crimes that foster a sense of disorder. The solution involves substantial policing, with officers who know the communities they patrol. Yet New York employs almost 3,000 fewer police officers than it did pre-Covid, a decline of 8 percent. Fortunately, Mr. Mamdani has stopped using [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/nyregion/mamdani-nypd-officers-police.html] the anti-police rhetoric he once did, and said he would ask Jessica Tisch, the current commissioner, to stay in the job. She has presided over crime declines this year and wants to hire more officers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani continues to favor alternatives to police officers in certain situations, such as encounters with mentally ill people. Some of these ideas have shown promising results elsewhere, although they typically require collaboration between social-services workers and police officers, given the safety risks. Ultimately, New York should pursue an all-of-the-above approach that combines more officers and alternatives when feasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: Major crime should return to the levels of the late 2010s, if not lower. That would require a decline of about 25,000 major felonies relative to the current annual level.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Education\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani has given less attention to education policy than he has to some other areas. He has even proposed that the mayor give up control [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/nyregion/new-york-city-schools-mayoral-control.html] of the city’s schools and decentralize authority to teachers and parents. That would be a mistake. The K-12 school system, like early child care, is crucial to the city’s future. And the most successful models of educational progress have depended on a strong central authority.\n",
        "\n",
        "Children in Mississippi [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/31/opinion/mississippi-education-poverty.html] and Louisiana [https://www.governing.com/policy/how-louisiana-managed-to-boost-reading-scores], for example, have made exciting recent gains in reading thanks to statewide policies that combine teacher training and high standards; most students there cannot advance to fourth grade without meeting a literacy minimum. Chicago [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/opinion/sunday/want-to-fix-schools-go-to-the-principals-office.html] outpaced other big cities in the 2010s with a top-down model in which the city held principals accountable for their students’ academic progress. There are no similarly inspiring stories involving cities where mayors ignored the schools.\n",
        "\n",
        "We hope Mr. Mamdani uses the power he will soon have to improve the nation’s largest school district. He should be careful not to get bogged down by divisive issues — such as the future of relatively small gifted and talented programs [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/03/nyregion/gifted-program-new-york-mamdani-criticism.html] — and focus on the programs that educate the most children.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick:Only 29 percent of eighth graders in New York are proficient at reading [https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/districtprofile/overview/XN?sfj=NL&chort=2&sub=MAT&sj=XN&st=MN&year=2024R3&cti=PgTab_OT] and only 23 percent are proficient in math, according to federal data. That is roughly average for a large U.S. city. It is also unacceptable. Both numbers should rise substantially under the Mamdani administration.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Jobs\n",
        "\n",
        "Many business leaders are wary of Mr. Mamdani, if not outright alarmed, because of his embrace of socialism [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQnqrObDmVJ/?igsh=c3k3MG9qeDE3MjNi.]. But some executives who have met with Mr. Mamdani since his primary win have emerged hopeful [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/nyregion/mamdani-charm-business-leaders.html]. Both he and they should recognize that they have a common interest in the city’s well-being and in preserving its status as a hub of business and finance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani’s No. 1 promise is to make New York more affordable for residents. He should extend that goal to the city’s small businesses, which also are struggling. Prime targets include simplifying regulations and making better use of tax policy to support small businesses. One example: Landlords should have an incentive to offer longer leases to independent businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yardstick: More businesses have closed than opened in recent quarters. Mr. Mamdani should set a goal of increasing the number of businesses operating in New York [https://edc.nyc/sites/default/files/2025-10/NYCEDC-NYC-Economic-Snapshot-October-2025.pdf] by 10 percent during his first term.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani will take office on Jan. 1, 2026, with a reservoir of good will. He inspires [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/25/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-older-voters.html] young people who are cynical about politics. He will be the city’s first Muslim mayor [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/nyregion/muslim-voters-mamdani.html], its youngest mayor in more than a century [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/mamdani-age-mayor-young.html] and its first immigrant mayor since the 1970s [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/nyregion/nyc-immigrant-mayors-mamdani.html].\n",
        "\n",
        "But the reasons that many New Yorkers are skeptical of him also deserve to be taken seriously. He had almost no management experience before his campaign, and extreme rhetoric was his normal mode of communication until recently. He called [https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/mamdani-apology-nypd-00610378] the New York Police Department “a major threat to public safety.” He initially refused to condemn [https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/zohran-mamdani-jewish-vote] Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel. To this day, he proudly identifies with the Democratic Socialists of America, whose platform supports [https://platform.dsausa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSA_WDM2025Program_v2.pdf] open borders, voting access for noncitizens and a weaker U.S. military.\n",
        "\n",
        "He can win at least some of his skeptics over by getting results as mayor. He should start by building a leadership team light on democratic socialists and heavy on officials with records of accomplishment and proven management skills. He should then remain laser-focused on tangible improvements to city life. If he can build a more affordable city where New Yorkers feel as safe as they did in the early 2010s, where the subways and buses move more quickly, where both schools and early child care improve and where good-paying jobs are plentiful, he will have a claim on being one of the city’s great mayors.\n",

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton For Mamdani to be effective, he will have to grapple with the recent history of big-city civic leaders who promised bold, progressive change.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the most part, they have disappointed, as in Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Oregon, as well as New York City itself under Bill de Blasio.\n",
        "\n",
        "They have tolerated a level of disorder that many voters found unacceptable and have had difficulty making progress on affordability or elementary and secondary education.\n",
        "\n",
        "De Blasio had one major success that Mamdani rightly cites as an inspiration:\n",
        "\n",
        "universal preschool education, which has benefited hundreds of thousands of children.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, his overall record made him so unpopular that he failed to win the Democratic nomination for a House district in Brooklyn after leaving office.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani, whose campaign was based on ambitious promises, can forge a more positive legacy by focusing on tangible accomplishments.\n",
        "\n",
        "He should take note of successful mayors, both moderate and progressive, such as Muriel Bowser of Washington, Mike Duggan of Detroit and Michelle Wu of Boston, who have brought concrete solutions to specific problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani cannot solve economic inequality, the issue that drove his campaign.\n",

        "\n",
        "He can improve the speed of buses and subways.\n",
        "\n",
        "If he succeeds, he will offer a model of Democratic Party governance at a time when many Americans distrust the party and have abandoned Democratic-governed states to vote for Republican-governed ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout American history, political progressives have prided themselves on using government to alleviate extreme inequality and enable more Americans to live well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani has the opportunity to write the next chapter of that story.\n",
        "\n",
        "Targets\n",
        "\n",
        "In nearly every area that featured prominently in the mayoral campaign, Mamdani can improve life in New York by combining his admirable ambition with pragmatism and the ability to compromise.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will focus on six areas and offer an evaluation criteria for each.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Housing\n",
        "\n",
        "The cost of housing is a fundamental issue in New York City life.\n",
        "\n",
        "The city faces an affordability crisis primarily because its political leaders have drastically limited construction since the 1960s.\n",
        "\n",
        "They have made it difficult to replace existing buildings with larger ones in a misguided attempt to preserve communities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The result has been gentrification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supply shortages have driven up prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Until recently, Mamdani seemed determined to ignore the government's role.\n",
        "\n",
        "He blamed landlords and developers and advocated stricter rent stabilization, which does nothing to benefit those who do not live in rent-regulated housing.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, housing is one of the areas where he has shown himself to be willing to listen.\n",
        "\n",
        "In his campaign, Mamdani claimed to have changed his mind on the need for more private development.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is vital, as private developers have far more capacity to expand housing supply than the government.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can make a difference by supporting a more ambitious version of Mayor Eric Adams' \"Yes City\" plan, which would allow higher building density around transit stations and reduce elevator requirements, among other things.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani is right that the government also plays a crucial role in subsidizing housing for low-income New Yorkers, and has proposed building 200,000 rent-stabilized homes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The plan faces obstacles, but the goal is laudable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The benchmark:\n",
        "\n",
        "Experts estimate that New York needs about half a million new housing units over the next decade, so a good measure of Mamdani's performance will be whether the number of units under construction approaches 50,000 a year.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Transportation\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani has pledged to make buses free and faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of the two objectives, speed is the more important.\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster buses and subways would benefit almost all New Yorkers, especially those who commute long distances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Currently, local buses run at an average speed of only 13 km/h (8 mph).\n",
        "\n",
        "A bus-only lane on Manhattan's 14th Street has shown that improvements are possible, resulting in higher speeds, fewer accidents and more riders.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Unfortunately, a similar plan for 34th Street was stalled by the Trump administration).\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani's plan to offer free buses would undoubtedly reduce costs for many New Yorkers, but it would leave the system without the revenue needed to fund speed improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, free buses could diminish riders' sense of security, turning them into homeless shelters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ignoring these disadvantages is one of the mistakes that progressive leaders elsewhere have made.\n",
        "\n",
        "A better idea, pushed by transportation planners, would be to implement a reduced fare for all riders on major bus routes, especially those used by low-income people.\n",
        "\n",
        "If Mamdani and Gov. Kathy Hochul work together to make this a reality, it would streamline commutes and convince more people to use public transportation instead of the automobile.\n",
        "\n",
        "The criteria:\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani should aim to raise the average bus speed to 10 mph - an unfulfilled de Blasio promise - and the average subway speed to about 20 mph instead of the current 17.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Child care\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, typical New York families with young children spend more than a quarter of their income on child care, leaving little money for everything else.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani has promised to offer free, universal child care starting at six weeks of age.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a laudable goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decades of evidence have shown that high-quality child care is a good investment, both for children's development and for parents' ability to work.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is unlikely to fully achieve this goal, given its costs and lack of a clear revenue stream.\n",
        "\n",
        "He favors raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations, which Hochul opposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Still, it would be a significant achievement if he could fix the many problems with the current preschool system for 3-year-olds, including the long distances some families must travel for available slots, and begin to create a universal care program for 2-year-olds.\n",
        "\n",
        "The indicator: Only two-thirds of children enrolled in the 3-year-old program are enrolled compared to the 4-year-old program.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of 2027, all 3-year-olds should be able to enroll in a classroom close to home.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Public Safety\n",
        "\n",
        "Although crime has declined over the past two years, surveys show that many New Yorkers remain concerned.\n",
        "\n",
        "Their concerns are legitimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Crime remains considerably higher than it was before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
        "\n",
        "The rate of serious crime - a category that includes auto thefts, burglaries, aggravated assaults, rapes and murders - is aiming to be 25% higher this year than in 2019.\n",
        "\n",
        "The past few decades have offered compelling evidence on how to reduce crime, including petty crime that fosters disorder.\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution involves a substantial police presence, with officers who know the communities they patrol.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet New York has nearly 3,000 fewer police officers than before the pandemic, an 8% decrease.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunately, Mamdani has dropped the anti-police rhetoric he used before and has said he will ask Jessica Tisch, the current commissioner, to stay on.\n",
        "\n",
        "She has overseen a drop in crime this year and wants to hire more officers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani continues to advocate alternatives to police in certain situations, such as encounters with mentally ill people.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of these ideas have shown promising results elsewhere, although they often require collaboration between social workers and police, given the safety risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, New York should adopt a comprehensive approach that combines a greater number of officers and alternatives where feasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The criteria:\n",
        "\n",
        "Serious crime should return to the levels of the late 2010s, or even be lower.\n",
        "\n",
        "This would require a decrease of approximately 25,000 serious crimes from the current annual level.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Education\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani has paid less attention to education policy than to other areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "He has even proposed that the mayor cede control of city schools and decentralize authority to teachers and parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "That would be a mistake.\n",
        "\n",
        "The K-12 education system, like early childhood education, is crucial to the city's future.\n",
        "\n",
        "And the most successful models of educational progress have been based on strong central authority.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Mississippi and Louisiana, for example, children have made remarkable gains in reading thanks to state policies that combine teacher training with high standards; most students cannot move on to fourth grade without achieving a minimum level of literacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chicago outperformed other large cities in the 2010s with a centralized management model in which the city held principals accountable for their students' academic progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are no similarly inspiring examples of cities where mayors have ignored schools.\n",
        "\n",
        "We hope Mamdani will use the power he will soon have to improve the nation's largest school district.\n",
        "\n",
        "He should be careful not to get bogged down in contentious issues - such as the future of relatively small gifted programs - and focus on programs that educate the most children.\n",
        "\n",
        "The indicator:\n",
        "\n",
        "According to federal data, only 29% of eighth graders in New York are proficient in reading and just 23% in math.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is about average for a large U.S. city, but unacceptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both figures should increase significantly during the Mamdani administration.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Jobs\n",
        "\n",
        "Many business leaders are wary of Mamdani, if not outright alarmed, because of his adherence to socialism.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, some executives who have met with Mamdani since his primary victory are optimistic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both he and they should recognize that they share a common interest in the welfare of the city and in preserving its status as a center of business and finance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani's main promise is to make New York more affordable for its residents.\n",
        "\n",
        "He should extend that goal to the city's small businesses, which are also struggling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key measures include simplifying regulations and better use of tax policy to support small businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "One example: landlords should have incentives to offer longer leases to independent businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key indicator: more businesses have closed than have opened in recent quarters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani should set a goal of increasing the number of businesses operating in New York by 10% during his first term.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani will take office on January 1 with strong popular support.\n",
        "\n",
        "He inspires young people skeptical of politics.\n",
        "\n",
        "He will be the city's first Muslim mayor, the youngest in more than a century and the first of immigrant descent since the 1970s.\n",
        "\n",
        "But the reasons why many New Yorkers distrust him also deserve attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prior to his campaign, he had virtually no management experience, and until recently, his extremist rhetoric was his standard way of communicating.\n",
        "\n",
        "He called the NYPD \"a serious threat to public safety.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He initially refused to condemn Hamas after the October 7, 2023 massacre in Israel.\n",
        "\n",
        "As of today, he proudly identifies with the Democratic Socialists of America, whose platform advocates open borders, voting rights for non-citizens and a weaker U.S. military.\n",
        "\n",
        "He can convince at least some of his skeptics by getting results as mayor.\n",
        "\n",
        "He should start by assembling a leadership team with few democratic socialists and many officials with a proven record of accomplishment and management skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, he should focus on making tangible improvements in city life.\n",
        "\n",
        "If he succeeds in building a more affordable city where New Yorkers feel as safe as they did in the early 2010s, where the subway and buses are more efficient, where both schools and early childhood education improve, and where good-paying jobs abound, he will have enough merit to be considered one of the city's great mayors.\n",

        "The Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won the big prize of the night in the local elections in the United States on Tuesday by winning the battle for mayor of New York, where he faced the former governor of the state Andrew Cuomo, who was running as an independent. Millions of Americans went to the polls to elect mayors, governors, and pass new local laws in the country, in an event that has been widely interpreted as a first test of Donald Trump's presidency, one year after his victory at the polls. Turnout has been very high for a local election, especially in New York and California, indicating that resistance to the president has been an important incentive to go out and vote. The gubernatorial election presented an opportunity for Democrats to resurrect themselves a year after Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential defeat in New Jersey and Virginia, where Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger, who campaigned on an anti-Trump message, has won.\n",

        "\n",
        "U.S. President Donald Trump has paid more attention to the New York mayoral election than to the race to reach the government of Virginia and New Jersey. The Republican has tried some maneuvers to try to trip up the Democratic candidate, Zhoran Mamdani, who tonight in a historic battle, has managed to win the mayoralty of the largest city in the United States with a progressive, lighthearted program aimed at those who are having the worst time because of the rising cost of living. Trump tried to recruit former Democratic mayor Eric Adams, who bounced from the party after losing the primaries, but his weak pull in the polls led him to withdraw his candidacy in favor of Andrew Cuomo, a former Democratic governor who resigned over a sex scandal. During the latter stages of the campaign, Trump has explicitly endorsed Cuomo, a former Democrat, ahead of his own party's candidate, Republican Curtis Slywa\n",
        "\n",
        "But that's not all. Trump went so far as to threaten New Yorkers with withholding federal funds if Mamdani won. His trusted collaborators assure that this threat should not be taken lightly, according to CNN. The Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, has assured in an interview on CNBC that the government has a certain \"discretionary\" capacity. And he added: \"It seems that more money should be allocated to the states where people are moving to\". In reference to the possibility that after Mamdani's victory some high incomes will move to Republican states. Actually, it doesn't look like the Trump Administration has much of a realistic chance of taking funding away from New York without twisting some federal legislation.\n",

        "Machi Davis, 37, \"proudly\" cast her vote for Zohran Mamdani around noon at her polling place in the Bedford-Stuyvesant (Brooklyn) neighborhood. \"I haven't been this excited about a candidate since Obama,\" assures the New Yorker and Brooklynite. \"Instead of voting for someone because they're the lesser of two evils, it's nice to have someone to vote for because you want them to win and you believe in their program. Even if he doesn't get to do everything he wants to do, the spirit of what Mamdani is trying to do and why is right, and I have confidence that he will make the right decisions.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Davis is originally from Bedford-Stuyvesant, and his family has lived in the majority-black neighborhood for more than 100 years. In recent years, they have seen the demographic profile of the neighborhood change due to gentrification and the displacement offamilies because of the high cost of housing and living in general. Many of his own family members have left the city, he acknowledges. He therefore cites his \"concern for the working class\" as the main reason he decided to support Mamdani, who has made affordability the centerpiece of his campaign.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"When I think about the future, if I were to have children, I ask myself: what will it mean to be from Brooklyn? Fifty years from now, someone who is from Bed-Stuy is going to be a radically different kind of person than Biggie, or Jay-Z,\" he comments, citing two iconic African-American rappers born in the same neighborhood. \"I hope Zohran can make the city affordable, so people don't have to keep leaving.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "The cost of living has starred in the campaign, which should serve for the Democrats to refocus their strategy against Donald Trump. The irruption of Zohran Mamdani is explained, among other reasons, by his proposals against the increase in the cost of living. He has proposed public supermarkets, controlling the price of housing, etc. The Democratic candidate for New Jersey has also resorted to the cost-of-living argument in the final stretch of her campaign. For her part, the Democratic candidate for governor of the state of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, has defended that the cost of living for voters in her state is too high. And she has accused President Trump of being behind the rising cost of living basket for his own interests.\n",
        "\n",
        "A poll released this week by CNN reveals Americans' growing concern about market basket prices. Forty-seven percent of respondents place the cost of living and the economy as the number one problem facing the United States. The sentiment that the market basket is more expensive is widespread, even though inflation has moderated to 3% and new wages are growing at 4.5%, more than inflation, according to the latest data from the private labor market research firm ADP.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Federal Reserve Chairman summed it up last week: \"Consumers perceive that prices are higher. The reason they are so unhappy is because of the inflation we had between 2021 and 2023. You can say that prices are not going up as much now, but that doesn't mean that people are not feeling those higher prices because of the inflation we had two or three years ago.\" Inflation is not quite moderating and the rising cost of the market basket, coupled with heightened uncertainty, has elevated Americans' concerns about the economy, even though the U.S. maintains solid economic growth. This election may mark a change in strategy for Democrats, who believe they have found a weakness in Trump: the cost of living.\n",

The general assessment of the reform is that it was a productive, but modest, liberalization of the zoning code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supposing that one could draw a straight line from the 2019 rent law to City of Yes, one has to wonder if it's worth trading a modest upzoning for an extremely costly rent control law that's pushing more and more buildings into financial insolvency every day.\n",

He has proposed public supermarkets, controlling the price of housing, etc. The Democratic candidate for New Jersey has also resorted to the cost-of-living argument in the final stretch of her campaign. For her part, the Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, has argued that the cost of living for voters in her state is too high. And she has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of being behind the rising cost of living for his own self-interest. A poll released this week by CNN reveals Americans' growing concern about market basket prices. Forty-seven percent of respondents rank the cost of living and the economy as the number one problem facing the United States. The sentiment that the market basket is more expensive is widespread even though inflation has moderated to 3% and new wages are growing at 4.5%, more than inflation, according to the latest data from the private labor market research firm ADP. The Federal Reserve Chairman summed it up last week: \"Consumers perceive that prices are higher. The reason they are so unhappy is because of the inflation we had between 2021 and 2023. You can say that prices are not going up as much now, but that doesn't mean that people are not feeling those higher prices because of the inflation we had two or three years ago.\" Inflation is not quite moderating and the rising cost of the market basket, coupled with heightened uncertainty, has elevated Americans' concerns about the economy, even though the U.S. maintains solid economic growth.

Cuomo's arrival has raised some expectation at the polling station. \"Who are you going to vote for?\" a voter asked him. To which Cuomo jokingly replied, \"I haven't decided yet.\" In recent hours he has received the explicit support of Donald Trump despite the fact that another of the candidates is a Republican. \"The president does not support me. The president opposes Zohran Mamdani. The president believes Zohran Mamdani is a communist. He believes he is an existential threat.\"\n",

        "With Cuomo's vote, all three major candidates for mayor of New York have now cast their ballots. Mamdani has cast his ballot at his Queens polling place earlier in the day and Republican challenger Curtis Sliwa did so during the early voting period.\n",

        "In Virginia, polling stations have opened at 6.00 a.m. (12.00 Spanish peninsular time), and will remain active until 19.00 (01.00 Wednesday) to decide who will be the next governor in a race that pits Democrat Abigail Spanberger against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears to replace Glenn Youngkin, of the conservative party. It will be the first time in its history that this traditionally Republican state, which in the last two decades has increasingly shifted to the Democratic side, will name a woman governor.\n",
        "\n",
        "The election has unleashed enormous interest. In the 45 days of early voting, 1.4 million ballots have been cast, compared with less than 1.2 million cast in the same 2021 election in a state with 6.3 million registered voters. It has also moved big money for what is customary in a gubernatorial election. Spanberger, the clear favorite - polls had her up to 12 percentage points ahead of her rival - has raised $65.6 million, according to her campaign data. Earle-Jones, who has not received an explicit endorsement from President Donald Trump, has raised just over half, $35.5 million.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interest in this vote, interpreted as a referendum on Trump's management in his first ten months in office, is also measured in the number and influence of the personalities who have come to support the candidates on the eve of the appointment. Spanberger has been joined over the weekend at one of her closing rallies by former President Barack Obama; Trump was participating in a teleconference rally in support of the Republican candidates on Monday night.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the governorship, also at stake is the lieutenant governor's seat, for which Democrat Ghazala Hashmi and Republican John Reid are competing, and the attorney general's seat, which pits incumbent Republican Jason Miyares against Democratic challenger Jay Jones. These are separate candidacies: unlike other states, Virginia does not vote for joint slates. Also to be decided are the 100 state congressional seats, where Democrats have held a slim majority (51-48 at present, following a drop among Republicans) for the past four years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polls indicate that Hashmi is narrowly ahead of Reid. Miyares is considered the Republican most likely to prevail in this race, after his opponent became embroiled in a scandal surrounding a series of text messages in which he declared himself in favor of shooting a Republican representative and his family.\n",

        "New Yorkers elect a new mayor on Tuesday after a campaign drawing attention from far beyond America's largest city, with President Donald Trump branding front-runner Zohran Mamdani a 'communist'. The contest has focused on New York's rising cost of living, crime and how each candidate will be able to handle Trump, who has threatened to withhold federal funds from the city.\n",
        "\n",
        "Trump, who was born in the borough of Queens 79 years ago, has had a decades-long love-hate relationship with America's most populous city. New York represents many values contrary to the voters of the deep America, white and Protestant electoral base, with its diversity, which includes significant Jewish, black, Catholic and Latino populations. \"I helped New York City during its worst times, and now, while it is overrun with violent crime by Biden's migrants, radicals are doing everything they can to drive me out,\" Trump said in 2024, when he was facing criminal and civil charges in state and city proceedings.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "How did Trump go from love to hate? Trump's relationship with New York starts before Donald Trump himself. His father, Fred Trump, made his fortune building public housing in the blue-collar neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens. When Trump began his career there in the 1970s, the city was bankrupt and crime-ridden. Trump took over in the boom years of finance and real estate. In 1975, the Commodore Hotel, next door to Grand Central Terminal, was threatened with bankruptcy. Trump tried his strategy: siding with the working class and the thousands of employees threatened with layoffs; using his connections to Democratic Mayor Abraham (\"Abe\") Beame, in office from 1974 to 1977, a Brooklyn politician close to his father; and not paying for his investment by getting a 40-year tax break from City Hall. \"Whatever my friends Fred and Donald want in this city, they get,\" Beame once declared. In this way, Donald Trump learned the art of political manipulation and the use of public subsidies in New York. The ambitious young businessman set no limits for himself. He was determined to acquire the best address in the city, next to Tiffany's, and build the first Trump Tower. Under the age of 40, he succeeded and once again claimed a tax credit. Unfortunately for him, the mayor of New York had changed. Now it was Ed Koch, a Democrat and Manhattan native, who met his constituents on the subway and fought corruption. Trump went on the attack and won in court. \"Now the Court of Appeals has found that some of the most expensive and luxurious accommodations [...] qualify for a tax break. Does that make sense? Not to me,\" Koch said in 1984. Even then, New York knew who he was, but he was fascinated by Trump, who did interview after interview with reporters. Trump understood that Central Park was the iconic heart of the city, and twice he chose this backdrop to showcase himself. In 1986, when the park's ice rink had been closed for seven years and the $17 million spent by the city had not been enough to save it, he took it upon himself to relaunch it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second episode came in April 1989, when a young woman was raped and left for dead in Central Park. Five African-American and Latino suspects were arrested and quickly convicted; they would be finally acquitted in 2014. Trump took out a full-page ad in local newspapers proclaiming, \"RETURN THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!\" With minimal investment ($85,000), he was now at the heart of the political game, standing up for families seeking peace in his park. Well into the 21st century, the future president changed his status from New Yorker to national celebrity. He did so from his famous tower, hosting the reality show The Apprentice. Candidates waited for hours at the foot of the building for castings, and \"You're fired!\" became the mythical phrase of the show aired by NBC starting in 2004. In the same tower, in 2015, Trump launched his presidential candidacy, with a now-famous speech in which he claimed that Mexico was sending \"thieves\" and \"rapists.\" Only with time, the gentrification of the city, its democratic inclination and the return of regulation made the divorce inevitable. In 2020, after leaving the White House, he retired to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.\n",
        "\n",
        "Court proceedings Trump's relationship with his hometown became complicated once the Republican left the presidency. After Trump left the White House in 2021, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a major civil fraud case against him, alleging that he and his real estate firm had illegally inflated their wealth and manipulated property values to obtain favorable bank loans or better terms on insurance. A New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $464 million, but a higher court later removed the financial penalty while upholding the substantive ruling. Trump is seeking revenge against the Democratic prosecutor. James was indicted Oct. 9 on fraud charges and is the second GOP opponent to be charged in court in recent weeks. Also in New York, a jury convicted him in late May 2024 of 34 counts in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a payment to silence a porn actor who said the two had had sex. The trial included charges that Trump falsified business records to cover up a payment to silence Stormy Daniels, the porn actress who claimed to have had sex with Trump in 2006, while he was married. The $130,000 payment came from Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen to buy Daniels' silence during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, in what prosecutors allege was an attempt to interfere in the election. \"This was a rigged and disgraceful trial,\" an angry Trump told reporters after leaving the courtroom. \"The real verdict will be on Nov. 5 by the people. They know what happened, and everybody knows what happened here.\"\n",

        "Unsurprisingly, then, economists and policy wonks have almost universally disparaged New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s proposal to “freeze the rent.” Headlines like [https://reason.com/2025/10/20/zohran-mamdanis-socialist-housing-plan-could-crash-new-yorks-rickety-rental-market/] “Zohran Mamdani’s Socialist Housing Plan Could Crash New York’s Rickety Rental Market” and [https://www-ft-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/content/50ca59a9-4618-45b8-b96a-d46d983312f3] “A Rent Freeze Is Not the Answer to New York’s Housing Crisis” have proliferated. My colleague Michael Powell, summing up the prevailing expert sentiment, described the proposal (among others) as “magic realism.”\n",
        "\n",
        "But maybe his proposal is closer to political realism. The expert consensus holds that the way to bring down housing costs is to build more housing; and the best way to do that is to remove the regulatory barriers to a construction boom. When I interviewed Mamdani about his housing plans, however, he emphasized that although more building is necessary, it is not sufficient—or sufficiently fast. “We absolutely have to expedite the process by which we build new housing,” he told me. “But we can’t do that unless we also address people’s immediate needs.”\n",
        "\n",
        "In many places, especially those where the housing shortage is most severe, the politics of building new units is toxic. The perceived costs of development often inspire intense opposition while the benefits take years, even decades, to materialize. This dynamic cannot be neatly separated from ideal housing policy. Mamdani argues that “freeze the rent” is not just a way of delivering relief from exorbitant housing costs; it is the only way to get enough voters on board with a growth agenda. A growing body of real-world evidence suggests that he has a point.\n",
        "\n",
        "The case against rent control is simple and powerful: Housing is too expensive because there isn’t enough of it, and rent control makes that shortage worse. Most studies find [https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/science/article/pii/S1051137724000020] that, by limiting how much profit developers can earn, rent caps make them less likely to build new housing. Meanwhile, if landlords can’t raise rents enough to cover the rising costs of maintaining their existing units, then those apartments will fall into disrepair or be taken off the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "Among experts, the preferred solution to the housing crisis is to relax regulations around what kinds of housing can be built. But this approach, often called YIMBYism—“Yes in My Backyard”—has some practical problems. One is popularity. Although reams [https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/market-rate-housing-will-make-your] of empirical evidence show that building new homes tends to reduce housing prices in a given area, most city dwellers have the opposite intuition about it. They associate [https://www-aeaweb-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/articles?id=10.1257/jep.20241428] new development with rising rents, a higher cost of living, and displacement of existing residents—also known, collectively, as gentrification—and often oppose [https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/media/imp/harvard_jchs_hankinson_2017_renters_behave_like_homeowners_0.pdf] new development on those grounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another problem is timing: Even if laws are passed to allow more housing to be built, people won’t feel the results for years. “This is the core challenge for the YIMBY worldview,” Christopher Elmendorf, a law professor at UC Davis who has conducted several surveys on voter attitudes toward housing development, told me. “How do you get voters on board with an agenda that violates just about every law of electoral politics?”\n",
        "\n",
        "One answer, somewhat counterintuitively, might be rent control. In a 2022 paper [https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kwjem_v1], the political scientists Anselm Hager, Hanno Hilbig, and Robert Vief used the introduction of a 2019 rent-control law in Berlin to study how access to rent-controlled apartments influenced local attitudes toward housing development. The fact that the new law included an arbitrary cutoff date (it applied only to buildings constructed before January 1, 2014) allowed the authors to create a natural experiment, comparing otherwise-similar tenants in otherwise-similar buildings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Heading into the experiment, the authors hypothesized that having access to a rent-controlled apartment would keep tenants in their existing units longer and therefore make them more resistant to neighborhood change. Instead, they found the opposite: Residents who lived in rent-controlled apartments were 37 percent more likely to support new local-housing construction than those living in noncontrolled units. (Hilbig cautioned to me that “there is some uncertainty, since the confidence intervals are really large,” but that “the effect is definitely sizable.”) This gap was largest in neighborhoods that had experienced the sharpest rental-price increases over the previous decade. The authors concluded that by guaranteeing price stability, rent control eases residents’ fears that new housing will make their current living situation unaffordable. “The takeaway for me is that when people feel protected, when they feel secure, they become much less scared of change,” Hilbig told me.\n",

        "\n",
        "Rent control is also a clear political winner. Depending on the [https://www.redfin.com/news/survey-homeowners-renters-support-rent-hikes/] poll [https://papers-ssrn-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4811534], it garners anywhere from 75 to 85 percent support among voters. In a 2024 survey [https://papers-ssrn-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4811534] of 5,000 voters across the country, Elmendorf and his co-authors gave respondents a series of choices between several different state-level policy platforms—each consisting of a random set of positions drawn from 39 different policy issues—and calculated how likely each issue was to cause respondents to switch their support from one platform to another. To the authors’ surprise, they found that rent control is, as Elmendorf put it to me, “one of the most important issues in state politics today,” more salient to voters at the state level than even such hot-button issues as immigration and policing. And, unlike the process of building new housing, passing a rent-control law can deliver tangible benefits almost immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "Taken together, the Berlin study and Elmendorf’s survey suggest that rent control could be very useful to a politician seeking to woo voters, and to make residents more open to new housing development. (This of course still leaves the question of who builds or invests in new housing—more on that in a minute.) Mamdani seems to understand this dynamic. “Freeze the rent,” his signature proposal, would halt rent increases for people living in the roughly [https://www.nytimes.com/article/rent-stabilized-apartments-nyc.html] 30 percent of city units designated as “rent stabilized” under law, whose annual rent increases are determined every year by a board appointed by the mayor. (This policy generally does not apply to either existing market-rate units or new units.) But his agenda also includes a commitment to use city funds to build 200,000 new units of housing over 10 years—a target that would slightly exceed the 185,000 [https://furmancenter.org/news/press-release/new-york-built-185000-units-of-multifamily-housing-from-2010-2020] new multifamily units of all kinds built in the city from 2010 to 2020. Mamdani has also expressed [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-interview.html] support [https://www.derekthompson.org/p/what-speaks-to-me-about-abundance] for a YIMBY wish list of policies, including streamlining permitting rules, up-zoning wealthy neighborhoods, allowing apartment buildings to be built near transit, and relaxing regulations to allow for cheaper construction.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s important that when a New Yorker sees housing constructed in their neighborhood, they know that this is actually part of a larger housing plan,” Mamdani told me, citing both rent control and stronger tenant protections. “And so the arrival of additional neighbors won’t be considered something that would then expedite displacement within that same neighborhood.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether Mamdani is capable of pulling off this synthesis, or even willing to try, is unclear. He might not even be able to “freeze the rent” in the first place. The annual price increase of a rent-stabilized apartment is set by the Rent Guidelines Board, a government agency that New York’s outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, is reportedly considering packing with appointees who are unlikely to support Mamdani’s agenda, and Mamdani might not have the legal authority to replace them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps more important, Mamdani has sent mixed signals on just how committed he is to building more market-rate housing. His platform [https://www.zohranfornyc.com/policies/housing-by-and-for-new-york] states that he will meet his housing goals by tripling the city’s production of “publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes”—an incredibly narrow type of housing that is extremely difficult to produce at scale in New York City. In interviews, Mamdani has hedged on this position, claiming [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-interview.html] that he has changed his mind on “the role of the private market in housing construction.” Even so, he has continued to send contradictory messages, including his refusal to take a position on several pro-housing ballot measures. “The truth is that no one really knows what he’s going to do,” Alex Armlovich, a senior housing analyst at the Niskanen Center and a member of the Rent Guidelines Board, told me. “We’re all left staring at these vague, conflicting statements he’s made and trying to make sense of them.” (Armlovich said that whether he would vote for a rent freeze would be “context dependent.”)\n",
        "\n",
        "Setting aside the specifics of New York City government, though, Mamdani may have hit upon a winning political formula for cities and states struggling to respond to the housing crisis. When I put Mamdani’s argument about rent control to YIMBY organizers—the people who are working to pass pro-housing laws in cities and states across the country—I expected them to roll their eyes. Instead, they lit up. In nearly every blue state that has passed significant pro-housing legislation, they explained, introducing some form of rent control has been crucial to getting those bills across the finish line. “It was absolutely essential,” Alex Brennan, the executive director of Futurewise, a Washington State think tank that helped spearhead an ambitious housing-reform package that passed in May, told me. “Saying that we’re going to have a lot more housing five or 10 years from now isn’t enough. Legislators want to know: What happens in the meantime? What are we going to do for those folks whose rents are increasing by double digits every year? We needed an answer for those people.”\n",
        "\n",
        "[Ron Davis: The biggest myth about the YIMBY movement [https://www-theatlantic-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/ideas/archive/2025/07/housing-abundance-antitrust/683504/?utm_source=feed]]\n",
        "\n",
        "I heard similar stories from organizers in other states, including California and Oregon. “We’ve seen this over and over,” Henry Honorof, the director of the coordinating team of Welcoming Neighbors Network, a national umbrella organization for dozens of YIMBY-aligned organizations, told me. “When major expansions in housing availability in blue places succeed, they usually pass alongside tenant protections and rent stabilization.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The same dynamic appears to apply in New York City. Andrew Fine, the policy director of Open New York, the city’s most prominent YIMBY organization, told me that outgoing Mayor Adams’s relative success in getting housing built had much to do with the passage of a 2019 law that strengthened tenant protections. The law, Fine said, made progressive legislators more comfortable with pro-building policies. Fine spent much of the 2010s working on housing policy for the city. He watched as concerns around gentrification and displacement stymied dozens of proposed housing projects and efforts to change the city’s zoning laws. “That fear pervaded every single housing conversation in the city,” he told me. “We learned very quickly that you’re not going to get any support for new housing in an environment where people are scared of being priced out.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Rent control might be good for getting voters on board with more building, but that doesn’t make it good policy on its own. Rent-control laws must be carefully designed to avoid the outcomes that economists have long warned about. Most of the recent state-level rent-control laws, including those in California, Oregon, and Washington, tie their annual rent caps to the overall inflation rate so that landlords can keep up with their own rising costs. These laws also typically allow landlords to raise the rent to the market rate—subject to rent control moving forward—when a tenant moves out, which helps keep those units on the market. Mamdani’s rent freeze would have neither of these qualities. (When I pointed that out, he said he was “not blind to the pressure that landlords face” and would find ways to reduce their major expenses, which include insurance premiums, utility bills, and property taxes.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Rent control can also scare off investors and developers, even if the policy doesn’t apply to new construction, as Montgomery County, Maryland, learned [https://www-wsj-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/real-estate/wall-street-landlords-loved-these-d-c-suburbs-rent-control-ended-that-a8f166cb?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdm5DyLZPcmIwwvZQVyzZEUf5XkLmz5bHfOJc-Hc3ZLk8skGNetZUhZoxeN3k0%3D&gaa_ts=69022eb8&gaa_sig=dusMo0dVED6a2tBUpxyAL8PbMig2buADIdl5CmuoYWRaotiY5Ld0OQNuRHnSOYrYFLqVlEkrFBRogFWj130usg%3D%3D] when it passed a rent-stabilization law in 2023 only to watch new-housing investment plummet. Avoiding a similar outcome in New York, and other cities, might require some extremely skillful diplomacy [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/nyregion/mamdani-charm-business-leaders.html], if it can be done at all. “What my investors care about is whether a given political climate is going to be hospitable to their investments not just tomorrow, but five or 10 years from now,” Bruce Fairty, the chief development officer at Cypress Equity Investments, a national housing developer, told me. “A policy like ‘Freeze the rent’ would almost certainly have a chilling effect.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Another risk inherent to pairing a populist, fast-acting policy like freeze the rent with a series of politically tricky, slow-acting technocratic reforms, like eliminate height requirements for single-stair buildings, is that the technocratic reforms might never get done. Making it easier to build new homes requires upsetting powerful actors who benefit from the existing system. Tellingly, Mamdani has refused to take a position on a set of pro-housing New York City ballot measures, on the grounds that he is having “active conversations with labor leaders, elected officials, and other stakeholders.” If Mamdani becomes mayor and can’t or won’t defy the interest groups that oppose housing reform, housing won’t get built. Meanwhile, repealing a rent freeze would be a nightmare for any politician who tries it. Without enough new construction, the housing crisis will only get worse over time, tempting city leaders to engage in even more egregious forms of rent control, which will in turn make building homes even harder. This could trigger the kind of cycle that leads economists to compare rent control to bombing.\n",
        "\n",
        "So combining rent control with YIMBY policies is no sure thing. But the status quo, in New York and many other cities, is intolerable. The housing crisis has metastasized for years while leaders have failed to figure out the politics needed to address it. If rent control offers a way to break through that impasse, it might be worth the gamble.\n",

Pour représenter le district à l’assemblée d’État à Albany, la sortante Aravella Simotas perd la primaire démocrate face à un jeune homme de 29 ans, né en Ouganda de parents indiens, rappeur à ses heures perdues, un certain Zohran Mamdani, qui brigue aujourd’hui la mairie de New York. Un an plus tard, encore, Tiffany Caban, née en 1987, d’origine portoricaine, connue pour ses prises de position pour une réforme du système pénal, remporte le siège de conseiller municipal laissé vacant par Costa Constantidines. Grand chelem pour le DSA. Dans la presse américaine, l’encre coule à flots sur ce «quartier socialiste», surgi de presque nulle part. Mais les observateurs continuent d’y voir une bulle voire une anomalie. La population étant (un peu) plus diplômée et (légèrement) plus blanche que dans l’ensemble de la ville, aucune chance ou danger de propagation.

Chevilles ouvrières du DSA à Astoria, ils y sont arrivés un peu par hasard. «Quand on est revenus à New York en 2016 après quelques années à Miami où mon mari avait été muté, on cherchait un quartier avec une école Montessori (qui pratique une pédagogie particulière créée par Maria Montessori – NDLR). Il y avait l’Upper West Side (à Manhattan) où c’était affreusement cher… et Astoria», raconte Shawna, 35 ans. C’est donc dans cette partie du Queens qu’elle participe à sa première campagne électorale. La candidate pour laquelle elle frappe aux portes est quasiment inconnue. Shawna partage un point commun avec la jeune challenger que l’on commence par appeler par ses initiales, AOC: avoir été serveuse dans un bar. Après la victoire d’Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Shawna adhère au DSA et, tout en maintenant son activité de coloriste capillaire, la milléniale aux cheveux roux flamboyants s’y investit de plus en plus. En 2023, elle bascule dans le monde politique en devenant «organizer» (militante chargée de l’organisation – NDLR) pour Kristen Gonzalez, une autre élue socialiste (ils sont désormais neuf) à l’assemblée d’État. Depuis mars dernier, elle travaille à temps plein pour la campagne municipale de Zohran Mamdani.\n",

        "Autre chemin, même destination pour Josh, 32 ans. «C’était il y a cinq ans. J’avais des copains qui y vivaient. C’était très tendance, tout le monde parlait d’Astoria. Ce n’est pas loin de Manhattan, la vie est sympa avec des tas de restaurants», se souvient cet ingénieur spécialisé dans les données. Lui a rejoint le DSA après la campagne présidentielle de Bernie Sanders. «Le quartier était déjà progressiste mais, avec les changements, il est devenu cet épicentre dont tout le monde parle», ajoute celui qui a désormais la responsabilité des adhérents pour l’ensemble de la ville.\n",

À New York, les petites rivières personnelles ont fait un grand fleuve politique. La section locale du DSA compte actuellement 500 adhérents, tandis que près d’un millier de personnes sont impliquées dans les porte-à-porte qui se déroulent tous les jours, pointe avancée d’une «extraordinaire machine électorale», selon la formule de Doug Henwood, journaliste et hôte d’une émission de radio. «Plus on va avancer vers la date de l’élection (mardi 4 novembre – NDLR), plus les opérations vont s’intensifier», indique Josh, qui se dit «confiant» dans la victoire, alors que les sondages accordent toujours plus d’une dizaine de points d’avance au candidat socialiste.\n",

Selon Ted Hamm, professeur de journalisme à l’université Saint-­Joseph, sa plateforme programmatique a permis à Zohran Mamdani d’élargir l’électorat démocrate comme aucun autre de ses prédécesseurs: «Jamais la vieille garde n’aurait pensé qu’un socialiste, musulman, propalestinien puisse l’emporter. Bill de Blasio, maire progressiste entre 2014 et 2021, a mobilisé les Africains-Américains, les syndicats et d’autres composantes de la base démocrate typique.

Il faut y ajouter un ingrédient, qui pourra constituer un puissant levier pour le maire Mamdani: l’auto-organisation. Le «climat» radical ne s’exprime pas que dans les urnes. Astoria est le seul quartier du Queens où deux établissements Starbucks ont voté pour la création d’un syndicat. Depuis, l’un d’eux a été fermé dans le cadre d’un plan de restructuration de la direction de la multinationale, qui en a profité pour viser les magasins syndiqués.\n",

C’est au Athens Square Park, assis de chaque côté d’une table échiquier en béton, que le jeune homme évoque la fondation formelle de l’association en 2022: «Ces vingt à trente dernières années, des familles de Latinos, de Bangladais, d’Indiens ont été poussées vers la sortie à cause de l’augmentation des loyers. Nous nous mobilisons à la fois contre la gentrification et contre les négligences et pratiques de certains propriétaires, parfois des marchands de sommeil.» Lui-même a dû quitter Long Island, la banlieue de New York dans laquelle il a grandi, devenue trop onéreuse, pour migrer vers ce bout de Queens dans lequel il ne peut pourtant résider qu’à la condition de la colocation avec sa sœur et son beau-frère: 2500 dollars pour un T3. «Et encore, ce n’est pas cher», précise-t-il.\n",

        "\n",
        "Last year, New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation & Development oversaw drawings for 10,000 such affordable apartments, whose rents are capped so that tenants spend no more than 30 percent of their income on housing. For these units, the city received 6 million applications [https://www.amny.com/news/housing-lottery-new-yorkers-10000-units]. In other words, households had a one-in-600 chance of winning each lottery they entered.

Hidden markets—the subject of my research and my new book [https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780316566827]—can be cruel in their own way. Affordable-housing lotteries reward the ability to navigate complicated city bureaucracies [https://www.bxtimes.com/6-million-applicants-for-10000-units-housing-lottery-leaves-out-new-yorkers-most-in-need/], the strategic sophistication necessary to game systems, and the patience to wait for years, if necessary, to win a unit.

        "The problem is that demand for below-market-rate housing will always outstrip supply. Whenever a resource is available at a below-market price, more people will want it than can get it. Once that happens, communities need a way to decide among the applicants. Many communities try to manage excess demand for low-cost housing via dispiriting waiting lists. In Chicago, waiting lists for public housing can stretch 25 years [https://abc7chicago.com/post/affordable-housing-chicago-cha-section-8-portal/13232375/]. In New York, the waiting list for Section 8 vouchers, which provide rental support, was briefly reopened last June [https://nychajournal.nyc/new-nycha-section-8-waitlist-established/] for the first time in nearly 15 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "For cities concerned with equity, lotteries offer a superficially fairer way to decide who gets what. Lotteries can give each person an equal chance of winning or, if a municipality wants, can be designed to provide priorities to designated groups. Many cities provide priority to municipal employees or veterans. San Francisco aims to correct its past mistakes by offering priority [https://www.sf.gov/get-priority-housing-lottery] to families, and descendants of families, that were displaced in the 1960s through the 1980s by the city’s Redevelopment Agency.

        "\n",

        "Lotteries might mask how little affordable housing is actually available. Research in behavioral economics has systematically found that people overweight low-probability events [https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/stable/1914185?seq=1]. This quirk contributes to our demand for lottery tickets: You can thank it for recent Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots reaching the billions [https://www.nytimes.com/article/lottery-jackpot-record-powerball-megamillions.html]. But it also might give us unjustified hope that lottery entries will eventually lead to stable affordable housing when there truly is not enough to go around. People who might advocate for more development—or move to a city where they can afford market-rate rents—instead enter lottery after lottery hoping for their golden ticket.\n",
        "\n",
        "For most applicants, housing lotteries provide only an illusion of hope. In 1984, George Orwell imagines a downtrodden proletariat successfully distracted from its oppression by the prospect of winning a lottery with a “weekly pay-out of enormous prizes.” In that classic story, average workers would hold out hope that something better was on the horizon, rather than rising up to improve the status quo.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the real-world scramble for housing, individuals can take concrete steps to improve their odds of getting an affordable unit. One is to apply to many, many lotteries. This is commonly the advice of housing authorities themselves [https://housingconnect.nyc.gov/PublicWeb/]. In the spirit of expanding access, online platforms such as New York City’s have tried to make applying easy, in many cases with just the click of a button (although paper applications are typically accepted as well).\n",
        "\n",
        "But when lots of people are applying for many units, including ones whose configuration or location they feel lukewarm about, lotteries can be deeply inefficient [https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/stable/pdf/26723942.pdf?casa_token=tgKuETGcunEAAAAA:qy1AaT025R_m_KxEzTKMxUKELvpT_wHvNmxKIDqnYKYVkaib0GpTr4V7RQiqaswLPYsyDYZcdpz49k_WXD-JPePZekpOAkEagRPDX0VoBN80RKjdF1nQ]. Because of the luck of the draw, I may win a spot in your first-choice development, and you may win a spot in mine. Then, generally speaking, there is no practical way for us to swap. Indeed, affordable units might become golden handcuffs: When moving out of one means giving up a heavy discount, people have massive incentives to stay put, even when they’d much rather move neighborhoods or have a bigger or smaller unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improvements in lottery design could improve this weakness. One solution is to batch lotteries on a regular basis, say every two or three months, and let people rank their preferences for developments so that they have a higher chance of matching with the apartments they desire most. New York City and other places use similar centralized clearinghouses for seats in public schools, and the systems have lots of desirable properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another option is to give applicants extra entries each year that they can put toward developments that particularly interest them. This design—much like a charity raffle where you can enter multiple tickets in the drawing for the prize that you want most—at least allows people to express the intensity of their preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "But although these improvements can allocate the affordable apartments more efficiently, they will not make those units any less scarce. And cities cannot simply conjure up more. To build their own below-market-rate units—as New York mayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani has promised to do on a grand scale—they’ll need to redirect money from other priorities. Require too many affordable units from developers of new apartment buildings, and those projects become unprofitable and won’t be built at all.\n",

In this report, I will trace how, in response to the progressive-socialist threat to their power, Zionists and their allies are expanding government in new and frightening directions. The leading player in this operation, like in all good intelligence ops, is not a colorful or charismatic character.

        "Jessica Tisch, the New York Police Department Commissioner since 2024 who will definitely stay on if either Zohran Mamdani or Andrew Cuomo wins the mayoralty according to public statements made by both men, is the third generation of the billionaire Zionist family that has had prominent roles in shaping the city since the 1980s. Her grandfather, Laurence Tisch, bought CBS in the 1980s not long before his brother Robert bought the New York Giants, establishing the family, which had started in hotels and movie theaters, as the owner of two of the city’s landmark organizations. In the 1990s, Laurence Tisch was a member of The Study Group, the informal philanthropic Zionist gathering co-founded by Leslie Wexner and Charles Bronfman, which led directly and indirectly to the foundation of Taglit Birthright, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, and various other projects for Zionist continuity. Laurence’s son and Jessica’s father, James Tisch, is the chairman of the Board of Leows Corporation, the family’s flagship business. James’ wife and Jessica’s mother, Merryl, was the chancellor of the New York State Board of Regents, responsible for supervising all educational activities in the state; and is the chair of the State University of New York Board of Trustees, responsible for supervising the state university system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within this context of a family involved in media, finance, philanthropy, and part-time politics, Jessica Tisch, who is now 44, charted her own specific path: from security to administration to the cusp of politics with the backing of money. She started in the NYPD in the decade of the September 11 attacks; continued in the department in the 2010s; moved in the first half of the 2020s to the Sanitation Department, arguably New York’s most important after police and fire. She has returned in the mid-2020s to the NYPD as its commissioner, while also widely being considered a potential future mayor. Like Mamdani, Tisch is a product, this time a direct one, of the decades of Zionist influence that preceded her rise. Like Mamdani, rewinding Tisch’s career shows how she is the capstone to a project of military policing that began in the 1990s and 2000s but that has sharpened under pressure into a full-blown project of social control.\n",
        "\n",
        "That project began when crime rose in New York in the 1980s and 1990s in response to displacement and homelessness facilitated by WASPs, Zionists, and their allies co-opting city government to the benefit of finance and real estate. In response, Eric Breindel, the neoconservative Zionist editor of the New York Post who had extensive connections to Wall Street, arranged for the Post to back the then-longshot Rudolph W. Guiliani as a tough-on-crime candidate, delivering him Staten Island and so the city.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the same time, Michael Steinhardt, the Zionist financier who was integral in the reinvention of Wall Street in the 1980s, became the major donor for the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), which in turn was the major backer of President Bill Clinton, who shepherded to passage in Congress as his main legislative priority the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This act provided newly elected Mayor Giuliani and his police commissioner William Bratton federal funds for law enforcement, with certain conditions attached that increased local spending on policing as well as the size of the NYPD. The NYPD’s budget increased from $1.7 billion to $3.1 billion between 1993 and 2000, also leading to increased city spending, since, under the terms of the Clinton crime legislation, to receive federal funds the city had to spend funds of its own.\n",
        "\n",
        "During this period, “crime”—defined as everything from murder to unlicensed street vending—fell in response to across-the-board enforcement. After 2001, Raymond Kelly, Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s police commissioner, pushed this practice to its limit with the aggressive practice of “stop and frisk” in minority neighborhoods: a daily distillation of the broader disenfranchisement the black and Latino communities of New York had been experiencing since the 1970s.\n",
        "\n",
        "Kelly also made sure that the NYPD would benefit from post-9/11 funding of counter-terrorism measures, measures which hinged heavily on techniques for surveillance. And it was by channeling this new priority for social control that Jessica Tisch made her career beginning in 2000s. Fresh out of Harvard, she took “an analyst position available in what was then the counterterrorism bureau” of the NYPD. According to a recent profile in The New York Times:\n",
        "\n",
        "“Kelly…did not normally meet with applicants for such entry-level jobs, but he ended up interviewing her. ‘Probably because she was a Tisch,’ he said, adding that he had been impressed with her three Harvard degrees.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Probably because she was a Tisch” seems like a fair assessment of why the supervisor of 55,000 employees took the time to meet a twenty-something about an entry-level position. But Kelly and Tisch also shared the promising ground of a professional focus: Kelly was committed to surveillance-as-policing, and Tisch’s main interest was data and surveillance. At the NYPD, she began “developing the Domain Awareness System, one of the world’s largest networks of security cameras, including handling contracts to build and expand it.” According to a description of this work in a recent profile of Tisch in New York Magazine, she was Domain’s driving force and Domain her career-maker:\n",
        "\n",
        "“…Tisch, 27, was tasked with figuring out what to do with more than $100 million in unspent grant money from the federal Department of Homeland Security, which had just built a surveillance network to prevent another terror attack downtown. What if, she asked, the Domain Awareness System went citywide? And what if, instead of trying to stop a suicide bomber, the system tried to spot all kinds of crooks? What if it included the NYPD’s trove of arrest reports and criminal histories? When Tisch sent the privacy guidelines for the system to the lawyers at the New York Civil Liberties Union, they retched…The bosses had the opposite reaction: ‘No, you’ve made it. Congratulations,’ the former colleague recalls them saying.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on an initial grant of $350 million from the Department of Homeland Security and developed with Microsoft technology, the System consists today of “a surveillance network of more than 18,000 interconnected cameras—including those in the private sector—as well as law-enforcement databases.” The system, in one description, “assimilates data from several surveillance tools—license plate readers, closed-circuit television streams, facial recognition software and phone call histories—and uses it to identify people.” As these descriptions suggest, private corporations and nonprofits, for example Rockefeller University in Midtown East Manhattan, can buy in: providing their own cameras then linking them to the surveillance system run out of the NYPD. “And,” according to one report, “when Microsoft turns around and sells the technology to other cities, New York gets a cut.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Tisch was not only one of the developers, if not the developer, of the system; she also so impressed Kelly with her tenacity dealing with the various technology sub-vendors put in play by the project that he moved her up through the ranks. (She also may have impressed Kelly with her access to funds; the nonprofit the New York Police Foundation, which her uncle chaired and where two of her family members still sit on the board, provided some of the early contributions for testing her surveillance system.) Within a decade, “she became the city’s first information technology commissioner…and within months she was in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, struggling to create a contact tracing system and then a vaccine distribution system.” Throughout this time, Tisch was working with at least one like-minded colleague from a similar background. This was fellow Harvard graduate Rebecca Ulam Weiner, the granddaughter of the Zionist nuclear scientist Stanislav Ulam of the Manhattan Project, whose view of her grandfather’s work is instructive:\n",
        "\n",
        "“As someone whose job it is to keep secrets, I often wonder whether such an experiment [as the Manhattan Project] would be possible today, scientifically or socially.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Fast forward to November 2024, and an embattled Mayor Eric Adams, whose allies in the black community have increasingly moved away from him even as powerful Zionists have edged closer, appointed Tisch Commissioner. He did this despite vocal concerns from civil liberties advocates that, in the words of one, “It’s really alarming to see a commissioner who built her career on the infrastructure of mass surveillance.” Weiner is Tisch’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, and has let it be known that her department “relies on a mind-boggling suite of assets that Americans might otherwise assume are controlled by the CIA, FBI, DHS, Secret Service, or other agencies.” These include:\n",
        "\n",
        "“…a legion of intelligence analysts, counterassault and dignitary-protection teams, a flotilla of boats…surveillance aircraft, the nation’s biggest bomb squad, a counter-drone unit, a remote contingent of NYPD detectives…and a network of multilingual undercover operatives…”\n",
        "\n",
        "Among this “remote contingent” is NYPD Detective Charlie Benaim, “[whose] office could be any squad room in Brooklyn, but for years [has been] an Israeli police station near Tel Aviv,” where “Benaim’s been feeding an endless stream of information, in real time, to his bosses back at One Police Plaza.” According to Weiner, Benaim’s function is “asking the New York question, when something is happening, what would it look like it if it were to happen in New York City, and more importantly than that, how do you prevent it?” A new model for Benaim in answering these questions, apparently, is the Hamas uprising of October 7. This suggests either that the NYPD expects a coordinated attack from foreign operators; or that New York’s security leaders see the city as potentially under siege by its own displaced and ghettoized underclass and plan to respond accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Telling in this regard is the fact that Tisch’s top priority as commissioner is “doubling down on data-driven policing and surveillance,” an aim which has “sparked fierce criticism from watchdog groups that New Yorkers are living in a surveillance state.” According to New York Magazine, Tisch’s proposed reforms fall along four lines. First, she wants to expand actual surveillance capacities by expanding the city’s camera network “to include more privately owned cameras.” Second, she wants to extend the contract of one of Domain’s less reliable components, “the ShotSpotter gunshot-detection system” which “may result in confirmed shootings only less than 15 percent of the time, according to the comptroller’s office,” a fact which Tisch dismisses, “arguing that something is better than nothing.” Third, she wants to use data collected “to surge police resources down to a single block,” allowing for the department to deploy overwhelming force to tackle individual incidents in small areas. (This means essentially treating city policing as counterinsurgency warfare, and it’s not too different than the LAPD tactics that led to the abuse of Rodney King and the fallout that followed.) Finally, “perhaps the biggest change is that she wants to use those same systems and processes to fight ‘chaos,’ not just crime,” meaning that minor noise disturbances or unusual behavior could qualify for police enforcement via surveillance and surges. (Again, this is a retread of the 1990s: “Giuliani-style crackdowns, only with better gear.”)\n",
        "\n",
        "More instructively still, she feels this way despite at least one recent controversy suggesting that her policies have adverse effects on the very communities historically at the blunt end of militarized policing. According to The New York Times, in an August report, the NYPD used Domain Awareness System’s facial recognition software to identify and arrest for indecent exposure in April a 230 pound 6-foot-2 black man, Trevis Williams. The arrest was made even though a witness said that the offender was about 160 pounds and 5-foot-6 and even though “location data from [Williams’s] phone put him about 12 miles away at the time.” According to the Times, the fact that “a facial recognition program plucked his image from an array of mug shots and the woman identified him as the flasher was enough to land Williams in jail.” This is despite the fact that “other police departments…require investigators to gather more facts before putting a suspect identified by facial recognition into a photo lineup,” and despite advocacy from groups like the American Civil Liberties Union to “ban…the use of facial recognition by the police because of the risk of misidentification.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“In the blink of an eye, your whole life could change,” Williams told the Times about his experience, adding that he still gets panic attacks since his April arrest and subsequent imprisonment. The Times investigation did not report asking for a comment from the NYPD or its Commissioner. Nor did it report that, as early as 2019, 11,000 cases per year were being investigated by the NYPD with the help of facial recognition software.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite collateral damage from her policies, positive media profiles of “Commish Tisch” and her subordinates have been plentiful since her accession. In an April 2025 report in The News section of The New York Times, the paper had the following to say about her: She has “an unlikely and remarkable career”; is “the daughter and granddaughter of two strong women, neither of whom came from money”; “learned hard work by example”; is “talkative and purposeful, but circumspect”; is a “no-nonsense technocrat” and “incredibly competent”; commands “a huge amount of respect”; is “very businesslike,” “[takes] no guff,” and should run for mayor. New York Magazine, the city’s go-to venue for fashion and culture commentary, had run an equally complimentary profile in March of 2025 that included the same political prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "And, the month before New York Magazine’s profile of Tisch, Vanity Fair ran a profile of Tisch’s deputy Weiner titled “NYPD Confidential.” Headed by a black-and-white photo of Weiner flanked by members of her squad that seemed ripped from a promotional poster of Captain America, the article’s text gave its subject an equally marquee treatment, describing her as “laser focused,” “unfazed,” “poised, cultivated, pin-sharp, convivial, boundlessly curious, charmingly profane,” and “a lightning-quick study” who had “a wicked sense of humor.” All three of these profiles also emphasized, as The New York Times’ editorial board regularly emphasizes, a recent rise in crime in the city without honing in on its obvious causes: financialization, gentrification, and displacement.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Times is owned by the Sulzberger Family, whose members are ambivalent about Zionism but who have deep connections to Zionists. (Their executive editor, Joseph Kahn, is the son of a committed Zionist corporatist and runs in the billionaire Zionist milieu; their editorial page is dominated by Jewish Zionists of all political persuasions; and the former head of the Sulzberger family wealth office now heads Bill Ackman’s.) Vanity Fair is still owned by the Newhouse Family, which, as I reported in my recent investigation on the rise of Zionist power in New York, was vital to that project thanks to its ownership of Conde Nast. New York Magazine is dependent for its scoops on access to the city’s financial and philanthropic elite, many of them Zionists—its recent profile subjects include not just Jessica Tisch but Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg and Bill Ackman. The message from these media venues seems clear: the Zionist financial powers of New York are squarely behind Jessica Tisch, and want their readers to know it.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is not, in this context, a coincidence that the Times ran an article soon after Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic mayoral primary citing anonymous sources to report that Mamdani was being urged to keep Tisch on if he wins the mayoralty as a “steady pair of hands.” It is also not a coincidence that this story came during a period when Dan Loeb and Bill Ackman, younger Zionist financial-philanthropic operators, were attacking Mamdani as soft-on-crime almost daily and shifting their funding focus to Mamdani’s Independent mayoral competitor, Mayor Eric Adams, to the point of personally vetting Adams’s campaign manager before the position was filled. What this suggested at the time was a pincer movement, in which attacks by Loeb and Ackman pressured Mamdani into keeping Tisch on as a sign of faith in the establishment and détente with Zionism.\n",
        "\n",
        "And, in late October, with Mamdani still attacked by connected Zionist players for purportedly making Jews feel unsafe despite the fact that he has attracted significant Jewish support, this is exactly what occurred. On October 22, Mamdani announced, four days after Andrew Cuomo had announced the same, that he would ask Tisch to stay on should he win the election. The reported terms on which this “ask” was made are not encouraging when it comes to Mamdani’s leverage over Tisch if he is elected mayor. Details in The New York Times painted a scenario in which Mamdani had publicly (and factually erroneously) made Tisch the poster child for safety in the city without extracting any concessions from her camp in return. According to the Times,\n",
        "\n",
        "“…Mr. Mamdani confirmed his decision during the final televised debate before the Nov. 4 election. ‘Commissioner Tisch took on a broken status quo, started to deliver accountability, rooting out corruption and reducing crime across the five boroughs,’ Mr. Mamdani said at the debate. “I’ve said time and again that my litmus test for that position will be excellence’…Ms. Tisch’s allies have signaled for months that she would want to stay in the job regardless of the election’s outcome. [Mamdani] campaign officials declined to detail any conversations between the candidate and the commissioner, but said they were confident she would accept. Delaney Kempner, a spokeswoman for Ms. Tisch, referred a reporter back to an earlier statement from the commissioner stressing that ‘it is not appropriate for the police commissioner to be directly involved or to seem to be involved in electoral politics.'”\n",
        "\n",
        "Tisch’s strategic mix of aggressive behind-the-scenes lobbying and Olympian public detachment sends a message: as New York Magazine put it less than twenty-four hours after Mamdani made the announcement, she is “the Heiress Who Could Make or Break the Socialist Mayor.” Not long after this article ran, Hakeem Jeffries, the New York Democratic leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, ended five months of ostentatious non-endorsement of Mamdani with a statement endorsing Mamdani—specifically praising his willingness to keep on Tisch. Already, then, thanks to a series of private maneuvers and public feints, Tisch has been placed in the driver’s seat: the establishment’s cooperation with Mamdani is clearly conditioned on Mamdani’s continued acceptance of her.\n",
        "\n",
        "One difficulty of critiquing moves like these is that the conflation of “Jewish power” and New York is an old trope, in part because New York has been since the early twentieth century a Jewish city. So it should be emphasized, as I have emphasized in my previous report on this topic, that New York’s problem is not a problem of Jewish power. It is a problem of government-tied financialization at the hands of a small number of WASPs and then a small number of Zionists, and it has come at the expense of the people who live in the city, among them many Jews. Now, with a direct threat to Zionists’ influence in the person of Zohran Mamdani, the operation is out front. Zionist financiers have sent one of their own to occupy the most powerful security position in the city, and they are intent on keeping her there. If they fail to install their ally Andrew Cuomo in the mayoralty, which will give Tisch carte blanche, the prospect of them working to sabotage a Mamdani mayoralty in the lead-up to a Tisch For Mayor campaign in 2029 is a very real one.\n",
        "\n",
        "They will likely do this much like they managed the securance of Jessica Tisch’s job: with media attacks meant to maximize pressure on Mamdani; followed by private assurances to Mamdani that the attacks will stop if concessions follow. These public-private feints, in turn, will push Mamdani into concessions which will make him lose face with his base, isolating him between an unfriendly establishment and a disillusioned electorate. (This trend is already occurring, albeit at the edges, after Mamdani’s public commitment to keeping Tisch, whom many Mamdani voters see as a threat to civil liberties.) Tisch’s allies will manage these plays with the help of The New York Times and other organs of influence (the Conde Nast publications, New York Magazine, the New York Post) which by their own admission are pining for technocratic government predicated on what they call “effective management.”\n",
        "\n",
        "But there is another equally bad outcome that could accrue should Mamdani win the mayoralty and Tisch stay on as police commissioner. This is the fusion of the most dangerous potential aspect of socialism, total government direction of the economy, with the most dangerous potential aspect of Zionism: total techno-military colonial control. It doesn’t take a great deal of imagination to see how, under a de facto power-sharing agreement between Mamdani and Tisch (Mamdani in charge of domestic welfare, Tisch in charge of security) the worst impulses of both systems will merge to create a city government which is totalistically involved in every aspect of its citizens’ lives, Singapore transfused with Sweden. This outcome for a city which for a century has been read as a triumph of American individualism would be, to understate the case, a seismic shift.\n",

        "NEW YORK CITY — Il n’y a pas très longtemps, un samedi matin, Susan Metz, enseignante retraitée de la fonction publique, s'époumonait au milieu de la foule lors de la manifestation « No Kings » (Pas de rois) qui se déroulait sur la Grand Army Plaza à Brooklyn. Cependant, ce n'est pas le président Trump qui était la cible de sa colère. Elle s'en prenait à deux démocrates originaires du centre de Brooklyn : Hakeem Jeffries, leader du parti à la Chambre des représentants, et Chuck Schumer, chef de la minorité au Sénat. « Appelez Jeffries et dites-lui de soutenir Zohran. Tout de suite ! », hurlait Mme Metz, 82 ans, lors du passage des manifestants. « Remettez-lui les idées en place ! » Vendredi, lorsque M. Jeffries a finalement apporté son soutien à Zohran Mamdani pour la course à la mairie de New York, beaucoup ont vu dans cette décision moins un soutien qu'une capitulation dans la lutte pour l'avenir du Parti démocrate. Cette bataille se déroule dans un périmètre exceptionnellement réduit, Brooklyn, où deux des personnalités les plus puissantes du parti ont du mal à freiner l'ascension fulgurante d'un mouvement progressiste incarné par M. Mamdani. Par moments, l'immeuble d'avant-guerre de M. Schumer, qui surplombe Prospect Park, ressemblait à une tour assiégée ; il ne s’est toujours pas rallié à M. Mamdani. « J'espère qu'il va se décider ! », s'est exclamée Vicki Winters, 68 ans, en tapant sur son tambour lors de la manifestation « No Kings ». M. Mamdani, ce socialiste démocrate de 34 ans, vit dans le Queens. Cependant, selon les données relatives aux votes et aux dons, ses plus fervents partisans résident principalement dans le centre de Brooklyn. Il n'est pas rare que les habitants affirment avoir reçu la visite d'une demi-douzaine de ses militants chargés de faire du porte-à-porte. Résolument urbain, d'une diversité infinie et farouchement égocentrique, le quartier de Brooklyn n'est pas vraiment représentatif de l'Amérique. A l'avant-garde des révolutions du compostage et du lait d'avoine, il s'apprête aujourd'hui à servir au monde entier son nouveau cocktail signature. Il n'en reste pas moins que cet arrondissement de New York rassemble tous les profils types des électeurs du Parti démocrate : les diplômés de l'enseignement supérieur, les étrangers qui ont récemment immigré aux Etats-Unis, les minorités et les électeurs noirs de la classe ouvrière. « Ici, on trouve des personnes de tous les horizons, de toutes les classes sociales, de toutes les origines ethniques et de toutes les identités sexuelles », fait remarquer Mme Winters, agente de voyage et actrice de temps à autre (elle a par exemple joué le rôle du « juré numéro 10 » dans un épisode de la série New York, Police judiciaire). En raison de sa situation géographique et des personnalités qui lui sont associées, Brooklyn se retrouve actuellement au cœur d'une bataille que l'ancien gouverneur Andrew Cuomo, principal adversaire de M. Mamdani, a décrit comme un enjeu existentiel lors d'un rassemblement électoral organisé dans ce quartier. « Cette élection ne se résume pas à un choix entre différentes personnes. Elle ne se résume pas non plus à un choix entre différents partis », a-t-il déclaré. « Elle porte sur des philosophies différentes et sur l'orientation que prendra le Parti démocrate. » Les leaders démocrates M. Schumer, 74 ans, et M. Jeffries, 55 ans, viennent de milieux différents à Brooklyn. Le premier, fils d'un exterminateur de nuisibles de confession juive, a étudié à l'université de Harvard. Le second est un intellectuel issu d'une famille noire de la classe moyenne qui a réussi à gravir les échelons sociaux. Ils habitent à seulement 1,1 kilomètre l'un de l'autre, soit une quinzaine de minutes à pied le long d'immeubles bas, d'une aire de jeux et de belles maisons en grès brun, dont beaucoup arborent des pancartes « Free Palestine » (Libérez la Palestine) et « Cease Fire Now » (Cessez le feu maintenant). S'ils remportaient ne serait-ce que quelques sièges lors des élections de mi-mandat l'année prochaine, les démocrates reprendraient le contrôle de la Chambre des représentants, ce qui leur permettrait de faire barrage au programme de Donald Trump. M. Jeffries deviendrait alors le premier président noir de la chambre basse du Congrès américain. Mais il n'est pas exclu que M. Mamdani et d'autres membres de l'aile gauche altèrent l'image du parti dans le pays. Néanmoins, en gardant leurs distances par rapport au courant socialiste, MM. Schumer et Jeffries attisent la colère dans leur propre fief : certains électeurs leur reprochent d'être à la botte des donateurs de Washington. Avant que M. Jeffries ne cède vendredi, le bruit courait qu’il pourrait se présenter contre M. Mamdani aux élections primaires. Par ailleurs, plus M. Schumer résistera, plus les rumeurs concernant son éventuelle intention de prendre sa retraite à la fin de son mandat s'intensifieront. Ainsi, les deux hommes se retrouvent dans une position inconfortable, pris entre leur parti et leur quartier, entre une élite qui tente de garder la main et une jeune génération avide de pouvoir. « Je ne les envie pas », souligne Ken Fisher, 72 ans, avocat spécialisé dans l'aménagement du territoire et ancien membre du conseil municipal. « Je comprends maintenant ce qu'ont ressenti mes parents lorsqu'ils se sont réveillés un matin en apprenant que George McGovern était le candidat démocrate à la présidence et non Hubert Humphrey », ajoute-t-il. Il compare en effet la victoire inattendue de M. Mamdani aux primaires aux bouleversements politiques que les Etats-Unis ont connus à la fin des années 1960 et au début des années 1970. Si M. Mamdani représente un nouveau visage, explique M. Fisher, son succès reflète une dynamique déjà ancienne à New York : un incessant brassage qui remodèle la ville encore et encore. Beaucoup de New-Yorkais n’y vivaient pas encore le 11 septembre 2001, sans parler de l'époque où l'on recensait plus de 1 000 meurtres par an. Brooklyn, en particulier, a évolué au gré des vagues d'immigration. Là où les communautés italienne et irlandaise dominaient autrefois, ce sont aujourd'hui les Chinois et les Sud-Asiatiques qui sont de plus en plus nombreux, de même que les jeunes Blancs. Ces derniers choisissent de quitter Manhattan pour s'installer dans les nouveaux gratte-ciel de Greenpoint, Williamsburg et du centre-ville de Brooklyn. « Cette évolution crée des opportunités pour les acteurs politiques, précise M. Fisher, comme cela se produit à New York depuis que les Britanniques ont chassé les Néerlandais. » « Guerre par procuration » A Brooklyn, la gentrification de certains pans du quartier a déjà commencé. C'est le cas du district 35, qui comprend les quartiers situés au nord et à l'est du magnifique Prospect Park. La majorité noire qui dominait auparavant a désormais cédé la place à une population blanche plus importante, les résidents de longue date ayant été contraints de déménager, ou ayant choisi de le faire, en raison de la flambée des prix des maisons typiques du quartier aux façades brunes, les brownstones. Crystal Hudson, 42 ans, membre du conseil municipal, décrit la politique locale comme « très à gauche, à peine à gauche ou légèrement à gauche », selon la saison. Noire et ouvertement homosexuelle, Mme Hudson vit toujours dans la maison en grès brun de Prospect Heights où elle a grandi. Dans les querelles politiques locales, elle a vu une « guerre par procuration » entre les Socialistes démocrates d'Amérique de M. Mamdani et la classe aisée. Il y a quelques années encore, cette dernière semblait garder la main : Eric Adams se distinguait de plus en plus sur la scène nationale en tant que démocrate partisan de la loi et de l'ordre. Aujourd'hui, alors que l'actuel maire de la ville qui ne dort jamais s'apprête à terminer son mandat, M. Mamdani est en pleine ascension. Il s’est récemment rendu dans un centre communautaire de Crown Heights pour s’entretenir avec des leaders noirs et écouter leurs revendications. Beaucoup concernaient le logement, un sujet sur lequel le jeune candidat socialiste a axé sa campagne. « La salle était bondée », raconte Mme Hudson. Lake Buckley, 35 ans, directrice artistique blanche originaire de la baie de San Francisco, vit désormais dans le quartier de Cobble Hill à Brooklyn. Elle a autant de mal à regarder une publicité de M. Cuomo que les adolescents n'en ont à écouter la musique de leurs parents. « Le décalage de Cuomo me tue », dit-elle. Vêtue d'un simple legging noir, elle prend des photos avec son iPhone rose de la manifestation carnavalesque « No Kings ». Mme Buckley avoue avoir des doutes sur certaines propositions politiques de M. Mamdani et elle-même n'est pas socialiste, mais elle semble avoir envie de tenter l'expérience. « M. Mamdani et son équipe ont très bien compris comment évolue la culture de l'attention », souligne-t-elle. « Nous retenons notre souffle » Il arrive que M. Mamdani provoque un certain malaise, comme dans ce bâtiment néoclassique situé à l'angle de Garfield Place et de la 8e avenue. C'est là en effet que se trouve la synagogue de M. Schumer : Beth Elohim. Rachel Timoner, rabbine de cette congrégation, critique depuis longtemps le premier ministre israélien, Benjamin Netanyahu. Certains ont pu entendre sa position dans un discours historique prononcé par M. Schumer en mars 2024. Il y avait alors reproché à M. Netanyahu d'être « bloqué dans le passé ». Pourtant, la congrégation se montre divisée au sujet de M. Mamdani. Ce propalestinien, qui milite depuis ses années d'étudiant, a refusé de rejeter l'expression « mondialiser l'Intifada » tout en affirmant ne pas l'utiliser, et à plusieurs reprises, il a accusé Israël de « génocide ». « Nous retenons notre souffle depuis deux ans », affirme Mme Timoner à propos de la détresse de la communauté juive depuis les massacres d'Israéliens commis par le Hamas le 7 octobre 2023, puis la guerre menée par Israël à Gaza en représailles. A quelques pas de la synagogue se trouve le Brooklyn Museum, dont la directrice de confession juive, Anne Pasternak, a trouvé sa maison recouverte de tags rouges et de graffitis l'année dernière. « Plus la situation se complique, plus nous sommes déterminés à ce qu’elle fonctionne », indique Mme Timoner au sujet de sa congrégation, qui compte des Israéliens, des Américains, de fervents sionistes, des détracteurs virulents d'Israël, des progressistes, des modérés, des personnes qui se souviennent de l'assassinat d'Yitzhak Rabin et d'autres qui n'étaient pas encore nées à cette époque. Un de ces derniers dimanches, M. Mamdani s'est rendu à une réunion du conseil municipal. M. Schumer n'était pas présent. Mais plus de 350 membres de la congrégation se sont inscrits pour y assister et ont soumis 82 questions, dont une sur la migration des oiseaux. Mme Timoner a félicité M. Mamdani pour avoir fait preuve d'une « grande humilité » et pour sa capacité à écouter. Cependant, certaines de ses réponses ont dérangé beaucoup de personnes présentes. « Certains ont dit qu’il n’y avait aucune chance qu’ils votent pour lui, mais qu’ils étaient contents d’avoir participé », affirme Mme Timoner. M. Cuomo vient s'exprimer cette semaine. Elle se défend contre les critiques de certains Juifs qui reprochent à sa synagogue de contribuer à « banaliser » M. Mamdani. « Si nous ne discutons pas, comment pouvons-nous être compris ? », estime-t-elle. L'ancien club-house Au Mill Basin Deli, situé à l'extrémité sud-est de Brooklyn, il allait de soi qu'il serait imprudent de donner une chance à M. Mamdani. Une vingtaine de membres de la vieille garde du Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club occupaient plusieurs tables jeudi soir, se délectant d'énormes sandwichs au pastrami et au corned-beef avant l'arrivée de M. Cuomo dans leur club-house. Frank Seddio, le président du club âgé de 79 ans, qui portait bretelles et chemise à monogramme, était le maître de cérémonie ce soir-là. « La plupart des autres clubs ont disparu depuis longtemps », précise-t-il. Après le dîner, alors qu'il se dirigeait vers le club-house, Joyce, sa formidable épouse, a dû l'empêcher de s'en prendre à un groupe de perturbateurs venus soutenir le candidat républicain Curtis Sliwa. A l'intérieur, le club-house évoquait une autre époque. Les portraits des anciens présidents ornaient les murs. Il n'y avait pas de représentants du mouvement « Hot Girls for Zohran », ni d'influenceurs, juste des chaises pliantes et dans l'assemblée, principalement des personnes d'un certain âge venues voir un homme politique en chair et en os. M. Cuomo est arrivé peu après 20 heures et a prononcé un bref discours. C'est lorsqu'il a abordé une proposition phare du programme de M. Mamdani qu'il a obtenu la réaction la plus vive : le gel des loyers pour les appartements réglementés par la mairie. « Les seuls à en bénéficier sont ceux qui poussent à la gentrification », a scandé M. Cuomo. « Eh bien, vous savez quoi ? Nous en avons assez de la gentrification qui détruit nos communautés. » Après son discours, les sympathisants l'ont rejoint, sous le regard de M. Seddio tout sourire. « Voilà, dit-il, c'est ça, la vraie politique. » (Traduit à partir de la version originale en anglais par Aurélie Henri)\n",

        "\n",
        "On any given weekend, the political energy in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park feels more like a movement than a campaign. Marchers beat drums, wave handmade “No Kings” posters, and chant for change—but their target isn’t President Trump. It’s the old guard of their own party. When House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries finally endorsed Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral race, it wasn’t triumph so much as surrender to a rising progressive tide that has redrawn Democratic battle lines in the borough, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n",

        "\n",
        "At 34, Zohran Mamdani—a democratic socialist from Queens—has become the face of a restless new generation of Democrats who see Brooklyn as their proving ground. His organizers have canvassed the borough relentlessly, reshaping local politics from Park Slope to Crown Heights. His base mixes young professionals, tenants, and activists who view the Democratic Socialists of America not as a fringe but as the party’s future. Brooklyn, a microcosm of the Democratic coalition, is now a pressure cooker of competing values: diversity, gentrification, and class tension.\n",
        "\n",
        "The establishment on defence\n",
        "\n",
        "For decades, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries embodied Brooklyn’s political ascendancy. Schumer, 74, came from a middle-class Jewish family and rose through Harvard to the Senate’s top ranks. Jeffries, 55, represents a younger generation from Brooklyn’s Black middle class. Together, they built the borough into a powerhouse of Democratic leadership. Yet as Mamdani’s campaign gained traction, both appeared hesitant—Schumer staying silent, Jeffries reluctant until the pressure became untenable. Their delay only deepened the perception that Washington Democrats were out of touch with their own neighbourhoods.\n",
        "\n",
        "A proxy war for the party’s soul\n",
        "\n",
        "In districts like Brooklyn’s 35th—where a once-Black majority has become a white plurality—the political spectrum now runs from “super left” to “just left.” Councilmember Crystal Hudson describes local politics as a “proxy war” between Mamdani’s DSA allies and the old Democratic machine. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, campaigning for the centrist side, framed it bluntly: “It’s not just about people or parties—it’s about philosophies.” To him, Mamdani represents an ideological challenge that could tarnish Democrats’ brand nationally, even as it energizes younger voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cultural clash\n",
        "\n",
        "The divide isn’t only ideological; it’s generational and cultural. Longtime Brooklynites remember Schumer’s synagogue speeches and local fundraisers. Now, Mamdani rallies spill into Instagram stories and TikTok clips. Young creatives and transplants see his campaign as part of a wider shift in how attention and activism intersect. “They understand the culture of attention,” said one supporter in Cobble Hill, echoing a sentiment that traditional politicians struggle to command the energy of the digital left.\n",

        "Schumer’s synagogue dilemma\n",
        "\n",
        "Even within Schumer’s spiritual home, Congregation Beth Elohim, divisions are sharp. Rabbi Rachel Timoner, long a critic of Israel’s right-wing government, hosted Mamdani for a recent town hall. The candidate’s refusal to disavow controversial pro-Palestinian slogans unsettled many congregants, still grieving the violence that followed October 7, 2023. Yet hundreds attended, eager to listen. “Some said, ‘There’s no chance I’m voting for him, but I’m glad we did this,’” Timoner recalled. For a borough shaped by activism, dialogue itself has become an act of political courage.\n",

        "Across town, the Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club—the last stronghold of Brooklyn’s machine politics—rallied behind Andrew Cuomo over pastrami sandwiches and folding chairs. Club chairman Frank Seddio, 79, dismissed the Mamdani movement as performance politics. When Cuomo denounced Mamdani’s proposed rent freeze as “a gift to gentrifiers,” the crowd roared in approval. “This,” Seddio said proudly, “is the real politics.” But even here, the unease was palpable—an acknowledgment that the world outside the deli no longer plays by old rules.\n",

        "Brooklyn’s fight mirrors the national Democratic tension between pragmatism and purity, between incumbents managing institutions and insurgents demanding reinvention. It’s about housing and identity, Gaza and gentrification, old power and new energy. The borough that once united the party’s most influential leaders now reveals its deepest divide. As one former council member put it, “Now I know how my parents felt when George McGovern replaced Hubert Humphrey.”\n",
        "\n",
        "In Brooklyn’s narrow streets and crowded town halls, the Democratic Party’s future is being written—not by consensus, but by contest.\n",

        "NEW YORK CITY -- On a recent Saturday morning, Susan Metz, a retired public school teacher, shouted amid a throng of protesters at the \"No Kings\" march along Brooklyn's Grand Army Plaza. The focus of her ire, though, wasn't President Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was two sons of central Brooklyn: Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrats' leader in the House of Representatives, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Call Jeffries and tell him to endorse Zohran. Now!\" Metz, 82, bayed as marchers filed past. \"Give him a good talking to.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "When Jeffries finally backed Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral race on Friday, it felt to many less like an endorsement than a capitulation in a fight for the future of the Democratic Party. That struggle has unfolded in unusually close quarters in Brooklyn, where two of the party's most powerful figures have strained to cope with a rising progressive movement, embodied by Mamdani, that is already looking past them.\n",
        "\n",
        "At times, Schumer's prewar apartment building overlooking Prospect Park has resembled a tower under siege; he has yet to endorse Mamdani.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I hope he's going to come out!\" Vicki Winters, 68, cried during the \"No Kings\" march as she beat a drum.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, lives in Queens. Yet many of his strongest bastions of support lie in central Brooklyn, according to voting and donation records. Residents commonly report being visited a half-dozen times by his door-knocking foot soldiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Urban, endlessly diverse and wildly self-obsessed, Brooklyn is hardly a template for America. The vanguard of the composting and oat-milk revolutions is now unleashing the faux Negroni on the world. Still, it is a kind of compressed collection of key Democratic Party constituencies -- the college-educated, recent immigrants, minorities and working-class Black voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You have somebody from everywhere and every income bracket and every race and every sexual identity,\" is how Winters, a travel agent and part-time actor (she played \"juror number 10\" on a \"Law & Order\" episode) described her native borough.\n",
        "\n",
        "By dint of geography and personalities, Brooklyn is now central to a contest former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a chief Mamdani opponent, portrayed in existential terms during a campaign stop there.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"This election is not just about different people. It's not even about different parties,\" he said. \"It's about different philosophies and the direction of the Democratic Party.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Democratic leaders\n",
        "\n",
        "Schumer, 74, and Jeffries, 55, hail from different Brooklyn milieus. One is the Jewish son of an exterminator who rose to Harvard; the other the cerebral product of a striving Black middle class. They live just 0.7 of a mile apart -- a 15-minute stroll past low-rise apartments, a playground and handsome brownstones, many with \"Free Palestine\" and \"Cease Fire Now\" signs displayed in windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "By flipping just a few seats in next year's midterms, Democrats would regain control of the House, allowing them to block Trump's agenda. Jeffries would become the House's first Black Speaker. The fear is that Mamdani and other left wingers could upend that by tarnishing the party's brand nationwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet by keeping them at arm's length, Schumer and Jeffries have stoked anger in their own backyard, where some constituents describe them as cocooned by Washington's donor class. Before Jeffries relented on Friday, talk of a primary challenge against him circulated. The longer Schumer holds out, the louder the whispers will grow that he plans to retire when his term ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "And so, both men are uncomfortably wedged between their party and their neighborhood; between an establishment trying to survive and a younger generation restless to seize power.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I don't envy them the task,\" said Ken Fisher, 72, a land-use lawyer and former city council member. \"Now I know how my parents felt when they woke up and George McGovern was the Democratic candidate for president and not Hubert Humphrey,\" he said, likening Mamdani's shock primary victory to the political upheaval in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n",
        "\n",
        "If Mamdani was a new face, Fisher argued, his success reflected a long-established New York dynamic: a relentless churn that remakes the city time and again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many current New Yorkers didn't even live there on 9/11 -- let alone when murders topped a thousand a year. Brooklyn, in particular, has been remade by shifts in immigration. Where Italians and Irish long reigned, Chinese and south Asians are rising. Young whites, too. Many bypass Manhattan for new high-rises in Greenpoint, Williamsburg and downtown Brooklyn.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What that does is it creates openings for the exercise of political power,\" said Fisher, \"which has been the pattern in New York since the British kicked the Dutch out.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "'Proxy war'\n",
        "\n",
        "In swaths of Brooklyn, gentrification already happened.\n",
        "\n",
        "That is the case in District 35, which includes neighborhoods north and east of leafy Prospect Park. What once was a commanding Black majority is now a white plurality, as longtime residents were either priced out or motivated to sell their now-pricey brownstones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Crystal Hudson, 42, its city council representative, described the local politics as \"super left, just left or a little left,\" depending on the season. Black and openly gay, Hudson still lives in the Prospect Heights brownstone where she grew up. In local political squabbles, she saw a \"proxy war\" between Mamdani's Democratic Socialists of America and the establishment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just a few years ago, the latter seemed to have the upper hand. Eric Adams was gaining national attention as a law-and-order Democrat.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now Adams is set to be a one-term mayor and Mamdani is ascendant. He recently met with Black leaders at a Crown Heights community center to hear their demands. Many involved housing, an issue on which Mamdani has staked his campaign. \"It was a packed room,\" said Hudson.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lake Buckley, 35, a white creative director from the San Francisco Bay Area who now lives in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill, struggles to even watch a Cuomo advertisement in the way many teens recoil at the sound of dad rock.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It kills me how out of touch Cuomo is,\" she said, dressed in black leggings and taking pictures with her pink iPhone of the carnivalesque \"No Kings\" rally. Buckley confessed doubts about some Mamdani policies -- and is no socialist herself -- but seemed willing to take a chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Mamdani and his team,\" she said, \"have a brilliant sense of how the culture of attention is shifting.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "'Holding our breath'\n",
        "\n",
        "In some other places, Mamdani stirs anguish -- as within the neoclassical building on the corner of Garfield Place and Eighth Avenue. It is the home of Schumer's synagogue: Congregation Beth Elohim.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its rabbi, Rachel Timoner, has been a longtime critic of Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. Some heard her voice in a landmark speech Schumer delivered in March 2024, criticizing Netanyahu as \"stuck in the past.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet the congregation has been torn over Mamdani. A pro-Palestine activist since his student days, he has refused to disavow the phrase \"globalize the Intifada\" (while saying that isn't language he uses) and has repeatedly accused Israel of \"genocide.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"We've basically been holding our breath for two years,\" Timoner said of the community's distress since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led slaughter of Israelis -- and then Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza. A short walk from the synagogue lies the Brooklyn Museum, whose Jewish director, Anne Pasternak, found her home smeared with red paint and graffiti last year.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"As it gets more dire out there, there's more incentive to try to make it work,\" Timoner said of a congregation that includes Israelis, Americans, ardent Zionists, intense critics of Israel, progressives, moderates, those who can remember when Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated and those who weren't yet born.\n",
        "\n",
        "One recent Sunday, Mamdani paid a visit for a town hall meeting. Schumer wasn't in attendance. But more than 350 congregants signed up to attend, submitting 82 questions -- including one related to bird migration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Timoner lauded Mamdani for showing \"deep humility\" and appearing to listen. Still, some of his answers were unsatisfying to many. \"Some said, 'There's no chance I'm voting for him, but I'm glad we did this,'\" Timoner said. Cuomo is visiting this week. She rejected criticism from some Jews that her synagogue was helping to \"normalize\" Mamdani. \"If we don't talk,\" she said, \"how can we be understood?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The old clubhouse\n",
        "\n",
        "At the Mill Basin Deli on the southeast edge of Brooklyn, it was taken for granted that giving any quarter to Mamdani would be foolhardy. Twenty or so members of the old-guard Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club filled a group of tables there on Thursday night, feasting on towering pastrami and corned-beef sandwiches before Cuomo was due to appear at their nearby clubhouse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Presiding over the festivities was Frank Seddio, the club's 79-year-old chairman, who was wearing suspenders and a monogrammed dress shirt. \"Most of the other clubs are long gone,\" he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "After dinner, as he shuffled down the block toward the clubhouse, Seddio's formidable wife, Joyce, had to restrain him from confronting a group of hecklers who had turned up in support of Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inside, the clubhouse evoked another era. Portraits of past chairmen lined a wall. There were no Hot Girls for Zohran or influencers, just folding chairs and mostly older people who had come to see a politician in the flesh.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cuomo arrived just after 8 p.m. and spoke briefly. One of the strongest responses came when he attacked one of Mamdani's signature proposals: a rent freeze for rent-stabilized apartments. \"The only ones it works for are the gentrifiers,\" Cuomo shouted. \"Well you know what? We've had enough gentrifiers destroying enough communities.\"\n",

        "The City Council, under Speaker Adrienne Adams (pictured), in using millions of dollars in government funds to mail out flyers denouncing these three questions is violating the law and even more of a reason to vote Yes on the measures, which will speed construction and do away with the pernicious local veto held by Council members.\n",

        "The Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on Canal Street was not a pretty sight. If President Trump wants to ensure Zohran Mamdani's election so he can \"take over\" the city, as he's warned, he couldn't come up with a spectacle more certain to drive liberal New Yorkers into Mamdani's camp than a squad of masked ICE agents, accompanied by an armored vehicle, descending on unlicensed street vendors in broad daylight to bust a whopping dozen or so for peddling counterfeit goods.\n",
        "\n",
        "But unlike agitators who screamed \"Fascist!\" at the agents, our emotions should be nuanced. With City Hall unable or unwilling to protect legitimate Canal Street businesses and the public from the scourge of unlicensed sidewalk merchants, somebody had to do the job or at least begin to - even if the optics were terrible and the results minuscule.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "I celebrate and honor the Big Apple's diversity and singularly colorful street life. But Canal Street's western portion is a civic disgrace. The cheap wooden animals, \"I â¤ï¸ New York\" caps and bogus Gucci and Cartier products - and the guys who sell them - have Canal in a stranglehold. The abandonment to sidewalk anarchy stalled a nascent revival that was on the point of making the run-down boulevard worthy of its potentially iconic crosstown location.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine how much worse it would be if misdemeanor-friendly Mamdani gave the hustlers even more free rein than they already enjoy!\n",
        "\n",
        "Developers began buying up small Canal Street properties a few years ago with plans to tear them down and put up modern new buildings. One owner told me in 2017, \"Canal is in significant flux.\" But that was before \"bail reform,\" \"Raise the Age\" and legions of leftist judges and elected officials made prosecution of most crimes short of murder ineffectual.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, little redevelopment has come to the street's western fringe since 2017. Reason No. 1: The lawless sidewalk scene scared off potential retail tenants needed to anchor new buildings.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I buy and sell and lease on Canal, so you can't use my name. It was already the worst and noisiest traffic bottleneck in Manhattan. But the vendors are the worst deal-breakers,\" one real-estate executive told me after the ICE raid. \"I don't like the way ICE did it, I'm the farthest thing from a Trumper, but somebody had to get a handle on this thing.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The day after the raid, with the hustlers (at least for now) chased out, I was able to truly see - and appreciate - the street for the first time I could remember. Canal Street's cacophonous western portion has long seemed more of a rough outskirt than a handsome boulevard the border between Soho and Tribeca deserves. Recent incremental changes made it a somewhat softer and gentler outskirt. The familiar engines of urban regeneration - lower rents than in neighboring districts, easy transit accessibility and enough surviving old-school grit to qualify as \"edgy\" - drew small boutiques, art galleries and even a hotel or two.\n",
        "\n",
        "The blocks along the Holland Tunnel approach now have enough interesting shops and galleries to seem cutting-edge, the way Alphabet City did before gentrification. A stroller west of Canal's bustling Chinatown portion will find the \"largest Banksy museum in the world,\" a former bank turned into a haunted house, Nordic Knots handmade rugs, the members-only \"Social Wellness Club\" and a Brooklyn Circus menswear shop. They uneasily share the sidewalks with mysterious shopping arcades and retailers of hardware, lighting fixtures, plastics and a thriving foam-rubber shop with a \"Now hiring\" sign.\n",
        "\n",
        "But as the funky brick-and-mortar improved inch by inch, the unchecked proliferation of menacing vendors made much of the street a creepshow, especially at night.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hustlers so dominate Broadway and Canal's south corner that my wife and I, having alighted from the subway, took a cab to a restaurant just three blocks away to avoid a gauntlet of aggressive, marijuana-puffing vendors backed by a soundtrack of boom-box rap music. The scene wasn't merely ugly - it was scary.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's not only my impression. NY1 reported last month that 800 local business owners signed a petition demanding more NYPD enforcement on and around Canal Street, citing open drug dealing, unreported muggings and robberies and sidewalk defecation. The NYPD responded that it's conducting \"targeted operations\" to stem the sleaze, but before ICE stormed in, there was little if any visible improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, shoddy goods fill sidewalks all over Midtown. Hustlers even took over the Brooklyn Bridge's narrow pedestrian walkways until a New York Post exposÃ© shamed Mayor Adams' team into getting rid of them (although they've begun crawling back).\n",
        "\n",
        "But it's particularly appalling on Canal as the street fitfully struggles to awaken from its decades-long limbo. ICE might not be to New Yorkers' taste, but neither should the prospect of an overdue urban renaissance cut short.\n",

Dans ce contexte, la campagne menée par Zohran Mamdani pour la mairie de New York offre une image radicalement différente de la vie politique. Tranchant avec les raids violents menés dans les quartiers résidentiels, les églises et près des écoles par l'ICE, l'agence fédérale en charge de l'expulsion des immigrés, elle a placé la joie au coeur de sa stratégie : en plus des traditionnels meetings, une chasse aux trésors géante organisée dans la ville pour les New-Yorkais, des vidéos marquées d'humour et d'irrévérence sur les réseaux sociaux, ou la traversée de Manhattan à pied par un Zohran Mamdani assailli par ses nombreux fans, la veille de la primaire.\n",

Sa campagne manifeste d'abord le renouveau d'une gauche politique américaine qui donne la priorité aux questions économiques et sociales (logement, accès aux soins, transports, éducation). Au sein de cette tendance, on a vu émerger au cours des dix dernières années une gauche multi et interconfessionnelle, qui mobilise et s'organise contre le nationalisme religieux. Le succès de Zohran Mamdani est lié d'autre part à l'inédite dynamique de construction de coalitions qu'il a su initier. D'une ampleur et d'une efficacité qui rappellent les mobilisations grassroots [mouvements initiés par les citoyens eux-mêmes] qui avaient porté Barack Obama à la Maison-Blanche, cette praxis collective du vivre-ensemble està l'opposé des fantasmes de guerre civile.\n",

        "Engagé de longue date pour la cause des travailleurs, Zohran Mamdani s'est d'abord fait connaître pour la grève de la faim qu'il avait menée en 2021, en solidarité avec les chauffeurs de taxi new-yorkais, victimes de taux d'intérêt prohibitifs sur les prêts contractés pour acheter leur franchise. Dans des discours aux intonations parfois populistes, opposant le peuple qui travaille et l'élite des millionnaires, le candidat proche de Bernie Sanders se définit comme le représentant de tous les New-Yorkais. Son programme inclut comme propositions phares la mise en place d'un service de bus gratuit dans toute la ville, le gel des loyers, la création des supermarchés gérés par la ville offrant des produits alimentaires à bas coût ou encore un système de garde universel pour les enfants de moins de 5 ans.\n",

        "Loin de la discrétion caractéristique de la précédente génération de leaders associatifs musulmans américains, Zohran Mamdani affiche ouvertement sa foi. Il se met en scène rompant le jeûne du ramadan en mangeant un burrito dans le métro ou visite les mosquées de quartier : « Nous savons qu'être musulman et se présenter en public, c'est aussi sacrifier la sécurité que nous pouvons parfois trouver dans l'ombre », déclarait-il [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-muslim-mayor.html] lors d'un rassemblement au printemps. Il est d'ailleurs régulièrement la cible de menaces de mort [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-threat-nyc-mayor.html]. Sa victoire à la primaire, notamment grâce au soutien de la communauté musulmane [selon le Council on American-Islamic Relations, plus de 350 000 des quelque un million de New-Yorkais musulmans sont inscrits sur les listes électorales, mais seulement 12 % environ ont voté lors de la dernière élection municipale en 2021, rapporte le « New York Times » [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/nyregion/mamdani-muslim-nyc.html]], constitue ainsi un tournant symbolique par rapport à la période de l'après 11-Septembre marquée par les surveillances policières des communautés musulmanes. Des organisations dédiées à promouvoir l'engagement civique et politique des musulmans de New York, telles que le Muslim Democratic Club of New York (dont Zohran Mamdani fait partie des membres fondateurs) ou la campagne « Muslim Vote », jouent un rôle important dans la mobilisation des électeurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "La trajectoire de Zohran Mamdani reflète l'avènement d'une nouvelle génération d'élus qui, depuis les élections de 2016, s'affichent ouvertement comme musulmans et de gauche. Cette affirmation constante mais discrète d'une gauche musulmane est souvent passée inaperçue du fait de l'engouement médiatique pour le groupuscule de notables musulmans conservateurs ayant affirmé leur soutien pour Trump lors des élections de 2024. Or le phénomène est bien réel. Depuis 2016, le nombre d'élus qui s'identifient comme musulmans dans les législatures d'Etat est passé de quatre à plus d'une vingtaine. On compte aussi un nombre croissant de musulmans élus dans les conseils municipaux ou nommés comme juges. La majorité d'entre eux appartient au camp démocrate et défend des valeurs et des programmes à la gauche du parti, qui mettent l'accent sur l'accès à la sécurité sociale et aux soins, l'égalité de l'éducation, les droits des minorités. Ainsi de Mauree Turner, élue démocrate à la Chambre des Représentants de l'Oklahoma de 2020 à 2024, musulmane, noire et non binaire ; de Ruwa Romman, Palestinienne-Américaine élue à la Chambre des Représentants de Géorgie en 2022 et réélue en 2024 ; ou de Munira Abdullahi, Somalienne d'origine, élue à la Chambre des Représentants de l'Ohio en 2022 et réélue en 2024. S'ils s'affichent ouvertement comme musulmans, ces élu.e.s ne mènent pas pour autant une politique identitaire. Dépassant l'alternative entre la revendication d'un droit à la reconnaissance ou au contraire à l'indifférence, cette nouvelle génération milite tout simplement pour un droit à une politique de justice et d'égalité.\n",

Des syndicats d'employés du secteur public, des organisations de défense du droit au logement, des organisations représentant des communautés d'origines haïtiennes, yéménites ou pakistanaises ont déclaré leur soutien au candidat. Leurs membres ont mené ensemble des opérations de porte-à-porte pour inciter les New-Yorkais à voter ou ont organisé des rencontres avec les habitants des divers boroughs (arrondissements). Mamdani met en scène cette identité oecuménique et plurielle sur les réseaux sociaux à travers ses vidéos de campagne où on le voit s'exprimer en ourdou ou en espagnol, déguster un plat de biryani, faire un discours devant les fidèles africains-américains de l'Eglise épiscopale méthodiste africaine (AME) dans le Queens [https://www.blackenterprise.com/zohran-mamdani-greater-allen-a-m-e-church-black-voters/] ou visiter le centre culturel du Népal [https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1902089634575733001].

        "Les soutiens les plus organisés et déterminants viennent d'organisations juives de gauche telles que l'organisation Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ), qui depuis les années 2010 a fait de la lutte contre l'islamophobie une partie intégrante de sa stratégie. Dès 2015, JFREJ avait organisé un soutien aux musulmans américains en lançant une campagne contre le Muslim Ban [décret présidentiel signé par Donald Trump en 2017 qui interdisait l'accès au territoire américain aux ressortissants de sept pays à majorité musulmane] et les crimes de haine visant les imams et responsables associatifs musulmans. La section politique de JFREJ, The Jewish Vote, a apporté très tôt son soutien à Zohran Mamdani, notamment à travers la campagne « Jews for Zohran ». Sophie Ellman-Golan, la directrice de communication de JFREJ, s'enexpliquait en ces termes [https://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-congressmen-endorse-mamdani-for-nyc-mayor-in-contrast-to-community-worries/] : « Ce que je peux dire en tant que juive new-yorkaise et membre d'une organisation juive, c'est que je pense que Zohran a fait un travail incroyable pour prouver à quel point il se préoccupe et s'engage pour la sécurité des juifs de New-York, de tous les New-Yorkais. » Plusieurs des proches conseillers [https://forward-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/news/753505/jews-zohran-mamdani-election-nyc-mayor/]de Mamdani viennent de cette mouvance de jeunes juifs de gauche parfois inspirés par la tradition socialiste et anti-nationaliste du Bund.\n",

        "Ces réseaux interconfessionnels et multiethniques de solidarité ne sont pas le fruit d'un simple calcul électoral supposé permettre à Mamdani de désamorcer les critiques et attaques liées à son identité musulmane. Ils reposent sur des relations de proximité et d'amitié multiethniques et multiconfessionnelles entre des personnes qui ont fait ensemble leur éducation militante et politique au sein de mouvements comme Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, Momentum ou Sunrise. Beaucoup des leaders de ces organisations ont été marqués par les enseignements de Marshall Ganz, enseignant à la Kennedy School de l'université Harvard, fils de rabbin, ancien secrétaire général du Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee et qui s'est formé à l'action collective au sein du syndicat des travailleurs agricoles, le United Farm Workers. De ses cours sur le « community organizing », de nombreux directeurs de stratégie et leaders des organisations qui gravitent autour de Mamdani ont retenu l'idée, chère à Marshall Ganz, que le pouvoir se construit avant tout à partir des relations humaines que l'on tisse à travers des luttes partagées. « La peur est contagieuse, mais le courage aussi ! » : aux Etats-Unis, la résistance à Trump s'organise au sein du collectif Indivisible [https://www.nouvelobs.com/monde/20250523.OBS104198/la-peur-est-contagieuse-mais-le-courage-aussi-aux-etats-unis-la-resistance-a-trump-s-organise-au-sein-du-collectif-indivisible.html]\n",
        "\n",
        "Un ingrédient essentiel de la victoire de Zohran Mamdani a été l'alliance qu'il a contractée lors de la primaire avec son concurrent et ami Brad Lander, le contrôleur de la ville de New York, chargé de veiller à l'intégrité des comptes publics. Ancien militant associatif contre la gentrification etpour l'habitat solidaire, Brad Lander a soutenu des mouvements sociaux tels que Fight for $15, un mouvement de revendication du salaire minimum à 15 dollars de l'heure. Le système de vote préférentiel adopté par la ville de New York - dans le but d'éliminer le recours à un second tour - permet aux électeurs de choisir jusqu'à cinq candidats en les classant par ordre de préférence. Si aucun candidat n'obtient plus de 50 % des voix, le candidat préféré est déclaré vainqueur. Ce système encourage les candidats à sceller des pactes préférentiels par lesquels un candidat invite ses électeurs à voter pour tel autre en deuxième position. Tel est le pacte conclu entre Brad Lander et Zohran Mamdani lors de la primaire démocrate dans un processus d'adoubement réciproque très médiatisé et commenté.\n",

Invités tous deux de « The Late Show », talk-show populaire de Stephen Colbert, Mamdani et Lander ont affirmé [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClNKD_6ow-g] lors de cette émission : « Les New-Yorkais juifs et les New-Yorkais musulmans ne seront pas divisés les uns des autres. » L'un des points forts de cette performance est la collaboration entre les deux candidats malgré leurs désaccords sur certains points. Cette invitation à une pratique de la politique fondée sur la coproduction sans recherche d'accord parfait exprime un projet politique qui contraste de façon saisissante aussi bien avec certains courants de gauche partisans de la politique de l'identité qu'avec le nationalisme religieux qui ne conçoit la communauté politique que sur le mode de l'adhésion totale.\n",

        "\n",
        "La solidarité entre musulmans et juifs new-yorkais puise sa force et sa légitimité dans une dynamique de coalition plus large, transconfessionnelle, interethnique et transclasse, grâce à laquelle Zohran Mamdani est arrivé premier en juin, aussi bien dans les quartiers gentrifiés que dans les quartiers d'immigrants à faibles revenus. La coalition construite par le candidat est conçue sur le modèle de la « big tent »[« la grande tente », une métaphore politique américaine pour signifier qu'on cherche à fédérer de façon très large]. Elle repose sur les comités d'action locaux du Parti démocrate, les grands syndicats du secteur public dans les secteurs de la santé et de l'hôtellerie, les organisations confessionnelles ou ethniques, les coalitions de défense de causes spécifiques telles que le droit au logement, le climat, la justice pénale, le droit des animaux. Parmi les très nombreux soutiens de Zohran Mamdani, on peut citer DC 37, la branche new-yorkaise du plus vaste syndicat de fonctionnaires (AFSCME-AFL-CIO), qui représente les travailleurs municipaux ; UAW-Region 9A, la branche régionale du plus grand syndicat de l'automobile ; 1199SEIU, le syndicat des travailleurs du secteur de la santé ; diverses sections locales du Parti démocrate ou du mouvement DSA ; des mouvements pour la justice climatique comme le mouvement Sunrise ; ou pour les animaux comme Voters For Animal Rights ; ou encore Riders Alliance, une organisation de citoyens qui milite pour l'amélioration des transports publics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Diverses organisations plus communautaires se sont aussi mobilisées. Point important : chacune de ces organisations porte aussi des revendications économiques et sociales. On peut citer par exemple CAAAV Voice, qui milite pour les droits des migrants asiatiques à bas revenus ; DRUM Beats, qui milite pour les travailleurs immigrés indo-caribéens et sud-asiatiques ; l'Alliance of South Asian American Labor ; YAMA Action, un groupe de plaidoyer pour les droits économiques des immigrés yéménites ; Make the Road Action, une organisation qui défend le droit au logement et les droits salariaux des travailleurs latinos ; Bangladeshi Americans for Political Progress, une organisation citoyenne qui promeut la participation politique des Américains d'origine bangladaise.\n",
        "\n",
        "A travers la campagne de Zohran Mamdani, une dynamique inédite de coalition populaire menée par une gauche juive et musulmane a donc vu le jour. Par elle, se construit un « nous » qui ne repose pas sur le postulat d'une origine commune et qui n'efface pas les différences. Distinct à la fois du récit nationaliste religieux d'une communauté pure et homogène et du mythe libéral d'une religion civile, ce collectif joyeux et hétéroclite met en scène ce que Zohran Mamdani appelle une « politique du futur » et de la solidarité. Quelle que soit l'issue de l'élection du 4 novembre, Zohran Mamdani a déjà gagné sur un point essentiel : il a réussi à introduire une brèche dans le contexte oppressant de dé-démocratisation à travers laquelle on peut encore s'autoriser à croire en l'utopie.\n",

        "Zohran Mamdani is a fearless warrior of the anti-Trump resistance, and the excitement surrounding his mayoral campaign extends far beyond New York. But, Konrad Yakabuski asks, is it good for the Democratic Party?\n",
        "\n",
        "Konrad Yakabuski is a columnist for The Globe and Mail.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "The Democratic Socialists of America are having a moment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once an obscure fringe organization that advocated overthrowing the capitalist system in the country whose name had long been synonymous with free markets – in other words, a seemingly lost cause if there ever was one – the DSA has been on a roll since one of its own became the front-runner to win New York's mayoral election.\n",
        "\n",
        "Zohran Mamdani's improbable victory in the city's June Democratic mayoral primary has sparked a broader debate about whether the sharp left turn that he and the DSA represent should serve as a template for the national party, which has floundered aimlessly in the wake of Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential election loss to Republican Donald Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "As Mr. Trump monopolizes global attention with one jaw-dropping violation of democratic norms after another, rewarding friends and punishing foes with alacrity, Democratic leaders in Washington have appeared spineless and weak.\n",
        "\n",
        "Too many Americans are unsure of what, if anything, the Democratic Party stands for, or feel it is elitist and disconnected from their bread-and-butter concerns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nearly two-thirds of voters view the party unfavourably.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enter the charismatic Mr. Mamdani, the 34-year-old Ugandan-born son of upwardly mobile Indian immigrants, who stunned the establishment and landed on Mr. Trump's enemies list by beating former New York governor Andrew Cuomo in the primary. He is widely favoured to top Mr. Cuomo, now running as an independent, in the Nov. 4 mayoral election.\n",
        "\n",
        "“In New York City, socialism has won,\" DSA crowed after Mr. Mamdani's primary victory. “These election results are a rejection of the Democratic Party political establishment and point to a widespread desire for an alternative to the status quo, and the need for the working-class political party DSA is building.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "In a mayoral campaign fuelled by thousands of DSA-recruited volunteers, Mr. Mamdani, a third-term member of the New York state assembly, has galvanized progressive voters by paying more than lip service to the statist policies they espouse.\n",
        "\n",
        "He has also built a multiethnic coalition of working-class New Yorkers with his promises to tax the wealthy, freeze rents and offer free buses and child care. He has put making life affordable for working-class New Yorkers at the crux of his crusade to take on the rich, couching his socialist politics in language average voters can understand – he coined the term “halalflation\" in a canny outreach to Muslim New Yorkers and food-truck aficionados alike.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani has drawn in apolitical or disillusioned New Yorkers with smart, funny and hip videos that have revealed communications skills perfectly suited to the digital age, and which make his older rival (Mr. Cuomo is 67) look awkward and out of touch. Behind a seemingly permanent and infectious smile, Mr. Mamdani has displayed a singular knack for the jugular, a critical political weapon in the noholds-barred Trump era that establishment Democrats decidedly do not possess.\n",
        "\n",
        "He has deftly ridden the zeitgeist as more New Yorkers question their country's unwavering support for Israel. He has mobilized young voters with his unambiguously pro-Palestinian politics, accusing Israel of “genocide\" in Gaza and vowing to arrest Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu (the subject of an International Criminal Court warrant for war crimes) if he steps foot in the city, positions Mr. Cuomo and establishment Democrats eschew.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He has captured younger residents. The 18- to 25-year-old cohort shows up less in elections than any other age group. But they appear to be energized by Mamdani's candidacy, given the New York City Democratic leadership, which is a pretty tired group,\" says Fordham University political-science professor Bruce Berg, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Mr. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid a slew of sexual-harassment allegations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Indeed, compared to potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidates who wear their ego and ambition on their sleeve – California Governor Gavin Newsom, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro or former Chicago mayor Rahm Emmanuel – Mr. Mamdani is seen as an authentic and fearless warrior of the anti-Trump resistance. The excitement surrounding his campaign extends far beyond New York's five boroughs. Since winning the primary, he has become a national sensation and a symbol of generational change within the Democratic Party.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It's clear this election has become nationalized,\" says Sheri Berman, a political-science professor at Columbia University's Barnard College, and expert on the political left. “There is coverage of this everywhere. He is being spoken of as representative of a potential future path for the Democratic Party. And then there's the contrast with Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "You've seen in the reaction to Trump's second presidency part of the left become further radicalized.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Prof. Berman is careful to distinguish between Mr. Mamdani's platform and his ideology. “His economic program is not entirely different from something that [Vermont Senator and former presidential candidate] Bernie Sanders would advocate. It is a kind of social democratic platform that a Canadian can understand. It's just not as far left as the U.S. has ever been. His membership in DSA indicates something more radical. DSA advocates the abolition of capitalism. That is just not going to happen at the New York City level.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Still, Mr. Mamdani's rise has arguably focused more attention on socialism in the United States than at any time since the early 20th century, when the prounion Socialist Party of America briefly became a political force, mostly in municipal politics. At a time when corruption was rife, public services rare and industrial pollution unregulated, socialist mayors pledged to build sewers and municipal water and electricity systems and end graft in municipal government. What became known as “sewer socialism\" emphasized the efficient delivery of public goods rather than the nationalization of the means of production.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the onset of the Cold War, however, the terms “socialist\" and “communist\" came to be used interchangeably as slurs employed by the right to discredit politicians who favour a bigger role for government in the economy. The tactic worked for decades. But younger Americans who were born or came of age after the fall of the Soviet Union are not scared off by the socialist label.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the same time, more Americans of all ages have been experiencing a crisis of faith in the capitalist system itself amid growing wealth inequality since the 200809 financial crisis. More than half of Democratic Party supporters now hold an unfavourable view of capitalism. More important, two-thirds of self-identifying Democrats have a favourable view of socialism, according to Gallup poll released last month.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has replaced the Republican Party's traditional support for free markets with protectionist policies that employ the coercive power of the state to direct corporate behaviour on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley alike. The invisible hand has given way to Mr. Trump's executive orders and jawboning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The President practises a form of crony capitalism that distorts markets and tips the scales in favour of the anointed few.\n",
        "\n",
        "The context does seem ripe, then, for self-proclaimed socialists such as Mr. Mamdani to offer Democrats a path out of the wilderness with an unapologetically progressive economic platform that pulls no punches when it comes to taking on corporations and Mr. Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "“[T]he moment for building a great progressive majority party has arrived, a coalition asserting itself against a sclerotic political elite, our economic overlords in Big Tech and Wall Street and a radical right crusading against its own country,\" George Washington University historian Timothy Shenk wrote last month in a New York Times essay that called on Democrats to embrace Mr. Mamdani's “eat-the-rich\" populism.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Turning Democrats into the vehicle for this coalition will take a struggle – a bruising, messy contest to seize the reins from a party establishment that will be scrambling for its life. But working people fight much harder battles every day. It's about time they had somebody in their corner.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Talk like that still rattles Democratic leaders in Washington. Neither Mr. Schumer nor Mr. Jeffries, the Senate and House minority leaders, respectively, have endorsed Mr. Mamdani. They have continued to toe a cautiously centrist line, arguing that the best response to right-wing populism – and most credible path to a Democratic victory in next year's midterm congressional elections – is to look reasonable in the face of the President's erraticism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many centrist Democrats fear that a win by Mr. Mamdani in the mayoral race could sink their party's chances of retaking the House and Senate in 2026. Indeed, they worry Mr. Trump – who has called him a “100-percent Communist lunatic\" – may welcome a Mamdani victory as a chance to cast all Democrats as “radical lefties\" and socialists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Still, in a sign of shifting winds within the Democratic Party, New York Governor Kathy Hochul did endorse Mr. Mamdani in September after initially hesitating for weeks. A centrist Democrat who is up for re-election in 2026, Ms. Hochul appears to have concluded that the Democratic rank and file is moving more in Mr. Mamdani's direction than that of Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries and that establishment figures like her need to adapt to survive.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the same time, Mr. Mamdani has moved to moderate his positions on a number of hot-button issues, making it easier for cautious politicians such as Ms. Hochul to embrace him.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before running for mayor, Mr. Mamdani left a trail of incendiary comments on social media. In 2020, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, he described the New York Police Department as “racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety\" and supported calls to defund it.\n",
        "\n",
        "He recently apologized for those comments and promised that, as mayor, he would maintain police staffing levels and create a new department of community safety to handle mental-health calls to enable the NYPD to focus on crime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani's initial refusal to condemn the expression “globalize the intifada\" also made him too hot to handle for much of the Democratic establishment. He has since said he would “discourage\" pro-Palestinian activists from using the phrase, which critics denounce as a call to violence against Jews. But he has not backed away from his tough stand on Israel, insisting in an Oct. 16 mayoral debate: “I would not recognize any state's right to exist with a system of hierarchy on the basis of race or religion.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He has continued to liken the situation between Arabs and Jews in Israel to that of apartheid-era South Africa.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no doubt that a Mamdani victory next month would make him a preferred target of Mr. Trump. The President has already frozen billions of dollars in federal grants for infrastructure projects in New York and has threatened to cut more federal funding if Mr. Mamdani takes control of city hall. He has not yet sent in the National Guard – not yet anyway – as he has in other Democratic-controlled cities. But Mr. Mamdani appears to be gearing up for a clash with the President, saying last month that he considered “inevitable\" the National Guard's deployment in his city.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We are in a period of political darkness,\" Mr. Mamdani told an Oct. 13 campaign rally. “Donald Trump and his [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents are snatching our immigrant neighbours from our city right before our eyes. His authoritarian administration is waging a scorched-earth campaign of retribution against any who dared oppose him.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Although Mr. Mamdani has maintained a healthy double-digit lead in the polls over Mr. Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, his election will hinge on which New Yorkers show up on Nov. 4. Only about a quarter of New York's roughly 4.7million registered voters typically turn out in mayoral elections.\n",
        "\n",
        "The scandal-plagued incumbent, Mayor Eric Adams, dropped out of the race in September amid single-digit poll numbers. Many of his supporters have turned to Mr. Cuomo, who is also backed by well-heeled New Yorkers – the city counts about 350,000 millionaires – and business owners who have warned that Mr. Mamdani's policies would lead to a flight of capital and undermine New York's status as a global financial centre. Mr. Mamdani also underperformed in the primary among Black voters, who associate him with gentrification efforts that have priced them out of their traditional neighbourhoods. He has strived since to change that perception.\n",
        "\n",
        "If he wins, the focus will immediately shift to Mr. Mamdani's ability to implement his policies, the costliest of which would include free child-care for children under five and free city buses. To pay for those policies, Mr. Mamdani has pledged to levy a special 5.9-per-cent income tax on millionaires (the city's current top rate of 3.9 per cent applies to all income over US$50,000) and increase the corporate income tax rate to 11.5 per cent from 7.25 per cent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Those rates would apply on top of state and federal income taxes, leaving New York with among the highest marginal tax levels in the country, and higher than some Canadian provinces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani would need the backing of the state assembly and Governor to adopt his tax proposals. While Ms. Hochul has been cool to the idea of raising taxes, several Democratic leaders in Albany have voiced support for his plan. His proposals to roll out city-owned grocery stores in each borough and freeze rents on the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments would not entail major upfront costs, but they would face stiff opposition from momand-pop bodega owners and landlords alike, not to mention many economists. But by far the biggest challenge to Mr. Mamdani's leftist agenda would come from Washington.\n",
        "\n",
        "“For a New York City mayor to be transformational, he'll need the support of the city council, he'll need the support of the Governor and he may well need an infusion of federal money,\" offers Fordham University's Prof. Berg.\n",
        "\n",
        "“If Trump cuts all federal funding, Mamdani will spend most of his mayoralty trying the patch the city budget.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Whatever happens, the whole world will be watching. If a Mamdani-led socialist experiment in New York goes badly, Democrats across the United States could pay the price at the ballot box.\n",
        "\n",
        "But if his 21st-century brand of sewer socialism – focusing on public goods that improve the lives of working-class New Yorkers – proves more successful than the naysayers predict, Mr. Mamdani may just show the Democratic Party its path back to power in Washington and the country a way out of Trumpism.\n",

        "Mr. Jeffries, the House minority leader, had resisted backing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, for months. But his support provides a late boost.\n",
        "\n",
        "Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor on Friday, the latest sign that skeptical party officials are swallowing concerns about their nominee as Election Day nears.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "The endorsement by Mr. Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, is more meaningful than most. A national party leader, he is also one of the city's most prominent Black politicians and has been a sharp critic of the Democratic Socialists of America, which counts Mr. Mamdani as a member.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Jeffries acknowledged that the two men had ''areas of principled disagreement.'' But he said that Mr. Mamdani had won ''a free and fair'' Democratic primary and emphasized that the party needed to unite against an ''existential'' threat from President Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "''Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy,'' Mr. Jeffries wrote.\n",
        "\n",
        "He added: ''In that spirit, I support him and the entire citywide Democratic ticket in the general election.''\n",
        "\n",
        "The endorsement came in written form just a day before early voting is set to begin. People familiar with his thinking said that Mr. Jeffries had planned to announce the endorsement earlier but pushed it back because of the ongoing government shutdown.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani welcomed the support, framing it as a sign that his campaign ''to turn the page on the politics of big money and small ideas grows stronger by the day.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Jeffries is the most recent member of the Democratic establishment to be won over by Mr. Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman and the front-runner in the race, as the mayoral campaign accelerates toward its conclusion on Nov. 4. Other notable endorsers in recent weeks include Gov. Kathy Hochul and Carl Heastie, the State Assembly speaker.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Jeffries's decision had been the subject of prolonged speculation, as the leader teased a potential announcement for months but repeatedly bristled when asked about it in television interviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both at home and nationally, he was under intense competing pressures. On one side are House Democrats and local leaders who believe Mr. Mamdani's success offers a progressive model; on the other are swing district candidates and donors who believe he will be potent fodder for Republicans in next year's high-stakes midterm elections.\n",
        "\n",
        "And hanging over all of it is the specter that Mr. Jeffries himself could face a left-wing primary challenge in his central Brooklyn district from forces aligned with Mr. Mamdani. The leader has said he would welcome one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mike Marinella, a spokesman for House Republicans' campaign arm, immediately sought to stoke Democratic infighting on Friday. In a statement, he said Mr. Jeffries had ''officially surrendered to Zohran Mamdani and the socialist mob now running the Democrat Party.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Several high-profile New York Democrats remain uncommitted to their party's nominee. New York's senators -- Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, and Kirsten Gillibrand -- have not made endorsements in the mayor's race and appear unlikely to. Jay Jacobs, the state party chairman, said outright that he would not endorse Mr. Mamdani, citing the candidate's democratic socialist beliefs and sharp criticism of Israel.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Jeffries's endorsement dealt a blow to former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who is running as a third-party candidate after losing June's Democratic primary. Mr. Cuomo has exploited festering divisions in his party to try to rally a coalition of moderate Democrats, independents and Republicans against Mr. Mamdani, but remains in a distant second place in the polls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Cuomo's longtime right hand, Melissa DeRosa, called at least two members of New York's congressional delegation this week asking them to try to dissuade Mr. Jeffries from endorsing Mr. Mamdani, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ms. DeRosa told Representatives Tom Suozzi and Joe Morelle, two Democrats close to Mr. Jeffries, that he should hold off endorsing because Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, could soon be quitting the race, potentially boosting Mr. Cuomo's electoral chances, the people said. (Mr. Sliwa has repeatedly made clear he will not drop out under any circumstances.)\n",
        "\n",
        "A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo did not immediately comment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Cuomo did pick up a high-profile endorsement of his own on Thursday from Mayor Eric Adams, a fellow moderate who abandoned his own re-election campaign last month amid abysmal polling numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Formerly hesitant Democrats like Mr. Jeffries appear to have gotten something out of their courtship with the nominee.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under pressure from party leaders, Mr. Mamdani has shed some leftist positions he held in the past, promised to apologize for comments calling the Police Department racist and said he would discourage the use of ''globalize the intifada,'' a phrase that supporters of the Palestinian cause have embraced as a cry for freedom but that many Jews see as a threat of violence.\n",
        "\n",
        "And this week, he confirmed a report by The New York Times that he planned to keep Jessica Tisch, the widely respected police commissioner, in her role if he is elected.\n",
        "\n",
        "In his statement, Mr. Jeffries cited several of those shifts. He called the candidate's commitment to keep Ms. Tisch ''the approach that this moment requires.''\n",
        "\n",
        "''Assemblyman Mamdani has promised to focus on keeping every New Yorker safe, including the Jewish community that has confronted a startling rise in antisemitic incidents as well as Black and Latino neighborhoods that have battled deadly gun violence for years,'' he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Public polling suggests that Mr. Mamdani is entering the race's final days in an enviable position. Mr. Cuomo has all but conceded he may not be able to win as long as Mr. Sliwa remains in the race and attracts a slice of anti-Mamdani votes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Jeffries first met with Mr. Mamdani back in July in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn, shortly after the candidate stunned New York Democrats by defeating Mr. Cuomo in the party's primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "But Mr. Jeffries had resisted offering his support amid a mix of parochial political disputes and concerns from swing district Democrats, who were put off by Mr. Mamdani's plans to raise taxes; his past support, which he has since disavowed, for defunding the police; and his statements on Israel, which have passionately divided Jewish Democrats.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two men discussed those topics at their meeting in July, and they met again in August, alongside pastors and other civic leaders, at Mr. Jeffries's home church in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Jeffries also had more local concerns. For years, he has been one of the most active players in a political and cultural struggle in his district. On one side is the older, moderate Black community that Mr. Jeffries comes from. On the other are the wealthier, progressive residents -- many of whom are white -- who are contributing to the area's gentrification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many of Mr. Jeffries's advisers see Mr. Mamdani, who handily won the congressman's district in the primary by activating young voters in remarkable numbers, as a representative of the gentrifying class. They worry that he and his allies could back primary challenges against local lawmakers who are to their right.\n",
        "\n",
        "After democratic socialists empowered by Mr. Mamdani's primary victory began crowing about potentially backing such challenges across the city, Mr. Jeffries's team seemed to stoke the fight.\n",
        "\n",
        "An aide to Mr. Jeffries told CNN in early July that if ''Team Gentrification'' wanted to challenge him in a primary, the response would be ''forceful and unrelenting.''\n",
        "\n",
        "On Friday, Mr. Jeffries said he appreciated that Mr. Mamdani had made a ''strong commitment'' to trying to build more housing and lower costs in ''working-class neighborhoods of color that have been hurt by gentrification and housing displacement.''\n",

But the six proposals [https://www.nycvotes.org/whats-on-the-ballot/2025-general-election/2025-ballot-proposals/] that will appear on the back of ballots could also have a major impact.\n",

        "\n",
        "Those measures have ignited a fiery response [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/nyregion/charter-revision-commission-vote.html] from the Council, which says they will leave neighborhoods unable to shape their future and instead hand power to housing developers and the mayor. Their proponents say they are crucial for addressing the city’s housing shortage.\n",

        "Proposals 2 through 6 were written, with public input, by the 13-member Charter Revision Commission that Mayor Eric Adams [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/nyregion/nyc-charter-revision-commission-housing-crisis.html] created in December, setting up a face-off between City Hall and the City Council.\n",

        "\n",
        "A “yes” vote would amend the Constitution to authorize the complex retroactively. The proposal’s passage would trigger legislation banning most further development not directly related to the complex. Gov. Kathy Hochul would need to sign that legislation.\n",

        "The state would be required to add at least 2,500 acres to the protected lands to offset the loss of land to the complex.\n",

        "\n",
        "A “yes” vote would make it easier and faster to approve housing projects financed by the city, which are typically the most affordable. The City Council would not get to vote on mixed-income housing developments in the dozen community districts [https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/what-the-charter-revision-commissions-ballot-proposals-may-mean-for-new-york-citys-housing-production] where the least housing has been built over the preceding five years.\n",
        "\n",
        "A “no” vote would leave the current system in place, where nearly all of these types of housing projects must go through a land use process and ultimately be approved by the City Council.\n",
        "\n",
        "Who supports this?\n",
        "\n",
        "The measure was one of the five written by Mr. Adams’s charter commission, and supporters view it as a simple way to speed up development of affordable housing. Mr. Adams blames the shortage, in part, on “member deference” — an unofficial veto that council members hold over new developments in their districts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alec Schierenbeck, the executive director of the commission, said its proposals would “create faster, simpler and less political processes for the types of development that New Yorkers frequently say they want most: affordable housing and modest projects that fit into the existing neighborhood fabric.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo is the only mayoral candidate that supports the measure. It is also backed by Ms. Hochul; Brad Lander, the city comptroller; and the borough presidents of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.\n",
        "\n",
        "Who opposes this?\n",
        "\n",
        "The City Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams, has characterized the measure as a mayoral power grab.\n",
        "\n",
        "They say that diminishing the City Council’s power over new developments removes the ability of members to negotiate benefits — like parks, subsidies for low-income renters and infrastructure upgrades — from City Hall and developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Council has sent mailers out claiming the measure would lead to “less affordable housing,” “fewer quality parks” and “more gentrification.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have real housing challenges, but these are false solutions,” said Julia Agos, a spokeswoman for the City Council.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several major labor unions are also opposed, including Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union and the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council. City Council members are often able to extract gains for unionized workers by threatening a veto over projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Democratic nominee in the mayor’s race, Zohran Mamdani, has conspicuously not taken a position on the measure. The Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa, opposes it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Proposal 3: Simplify Review of Modest Housing Projects\n",
        "\n",
        "This proposal for “modest” projects — up to 30 percent bulkier than current rules allow, or up to 45 feet tall — would allow such proposals to move forward more quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "A “yes” vote would shorten the approval process to three months from roughly seven. The City Council would no longer have the final say. That would come from the City Planning Commission, where the majority of members are appointed by the mayor.\n",
        "\n",
        "A “no” vote would leave the current process in place.\n",
        "\n",
        "Who supports this?\n",
        "\n",
        "A coalition of politicians, civic leaders and groups — including Mr. Adams, Ms. Hochul, Mr. Lander, Mr. Cuomo and others — support Proposal 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "They say that these types of “modest” developments will be more attractive to developers and therefore more likely to be built if the process is streamlined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Who opposes this?\n",
        "\n",
        "The City Council, some labor unions and Mr. Sliwa are also against this proposal.\n",
        "\n",
        "They say shifting the power from the City Council to the Planning Commission gives more authority to the mayor and removes the ability of individual council members to extract better benefits for their districts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani has not taken a position.\n",
        "\n",
        "Proposal 4: Establish an Affordable Housing Appeals Board\n",
        "\n",
        "A “yes” vote would give a new three-member board — made up of the mayor, the Council speaker and the local borough president — the power to reverse City Council decisions to reject or modify many mixed-income housing proposals.\n",
        "\n",
        "A “no” vote would leave the current system in place, where individual council members, with rare exceptions, decide the fate of development projects in their districts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Who supports this?\n",
        "\n",
        "This is perhaps the most contentious of the commission’s four housing proposals. It is, however, supported by the same group that supports Proposals 2 and 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supporters say that the unofficial veto held by individual council members ensures that many projects do not get proposed at all if there is a hint of opposition. And while the veto power may help defend the interest of a single neighborhood, supporters say the housing crisis should be tackled as a citywide problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Who opposes this?\n",
        "\n",
        "The same opponents point out how the proposal would undermine the power of the City Council.\n",
        "\n",
        "Developers could negotiate directly with the mayor and borough president and ignore the local council member, critics say.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This would give the city and developers significantly more power to disregard the needs of neighborhoods,” the City Council says on its website [https://www.whatsonmyballot.nyc/].\n",
        "\n",
        "Proposal 5: Create a Digital City Map\n",
        "\n",
        "Currently, each borough president is in charge of maintaining paper maps of each borough. The maps are the official record of street lines and street grades, and the locations of public parks and open space.\n",
        "\n",
        "A “yes” vote would require the city to consolidate and digitize the map under the Planning Commission.\n",
        "\n",
        "A “no” vote would keep the current map system in place.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike the three housing-related proposals, this one has seen little opposition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Proposal 6: Move Local Elections to Presidential Election Years\n",
        "\n",
        "Elections for city offices like mayor and public advocate are held in odd-numbered years at four-year intervals (like 2021 and 2025), while presidential elections are held in even years at four-year intervals (like 2020 and 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "There is typically more turnout for presidential elections. Just 23 percent of registered voters cast ballots in New York City’s mayoral election in 2021, while 60 percent participated in the 2024 presidential election, according to the New York City Campaign Finance Board.\n",
        "\n",
        "A “yes” vote would move city elections to even years. This would amend the State Constitution and would need to be also approved by two consecutive State Legislatures and by voters in a statewide referendum.\n",
        "\n",
        "A “no” vote would keep the election schedule the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "Who supports this?\n",
        "\n",
        "Moving city elections to even-numbered years could help “increase voter turnout, promote a more representative electorate and reduce election administration costs,” the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, has said [https://www.brennancenter.org/media/13920/download/4.15.25-brennan-center-public-comment-re-moving-municipal-elections-to-even-years.pdf?inline=1].\n",
        "\n",
        "The Charter Revision Commission said it would save an estimated $42 million every two years.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a statement submitted in favor of the proposal, the Center for Independence of the Disabled in New York said “higher-turnout elections typically come with more investment in accessible poll sites, better training for poll workers and greater outreach to voters.”\n",

        "\n",
        "One member of the Charter Revision Commission, Diane Savino, said [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8hOZC7yGUE&t=3063s] that she had concerns that holding the elections simultaneously could end up diverting attention from local races.\n",
        "\n",
        "Errol Louis, a New York magazine columnist, agreed. “National political dynamics would inevitably cause vital city issues unique to New York to get swallowed, distorted or ignored,” he wrote [https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-new-york-city-should-keep-off-year-elections.html].\n",

That being said, the No. 2 elected Democrat in the nation’s endorsement was far from enthusiastic.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy,” Jeffries said. “Yet, the stakes are existential.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The congressman from Crown Heights proceeded to talk about the threat that New York City faced, most recently in the form of the Justice Department targeting state Attorney General Letitia James, who on Friday pleaded not guilty to fraud charges brought by the Department of Justice under the Trump administration [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/letitia-james-not-guilty-fraud-charges-b2851624.html] .\n",
        "\n",
        "As always, much of the talk online about why Jeffries withheld his endorsement contained only partial truths. Many people questioned whether Jeffries’ support for Israel and money he has received from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee played into his decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "The truth is more complicated than that. Jeffries, like many Black politicians, never fully trusted progressives. The first time I covered him was when the Congressional Black Caucus’s PAC endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n",
        "\n",
        "During that endorsement, he lambasted Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mamdani’s political mentor, for voting against gun violence provisions. That skepticism bled into Jeffries’s endorsement of Mamdani.\n",
        "\n",
        "“For decades, working class neighborhoods of color have been hurt by gentrification and housing displacement,” he said. “That must change. I support our nominee’s strong commitment to building a City where everyday New Yorkers can afford to live. By necessity, this must involve a meaningful partnership with the private sector to dramatically increase the supply of affordable homes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sanders hasn’t done much to assuage Black Democrats’ fears [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/maine-senate-graham-platner-b2849506.html] about progressive flippancy toward racial justice given Sanders’s angry defense of Graham Platner after comments were unearthed about him asking why Black people do not tip.\n",
        "\n",
        "But despite his disdain for progressives, the left-wing insurgency landed him his current position in leadership and he’s been on the front lines of the internecine feud within the Democratic Party since Trump’s ascent. When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat Joe Crowley, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Jeffries campaigned for the job and won.\n",
        "\n",
        "That teed him up perfectly for Democratic leadership, being a manager during Trump’s first impeachment.

        "\n",
        "And in his home state, he has to deal with an ascendant left wing and Democratic Socialists of America contingent, including in his district. Had he not endorsed Mamdani, Jeffries would have likely faced a primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jeffries also has to acknowledge the shift within the Democratic Party when it comes to Israel. For many years, support for Israel was considered a sign of solidarity with the Jewish community, a staple within the Democratic coalition.\n",

        "\n",
        "The same poll showed that a combined 47 percent of New Yorkers tended to sympathize more with Palestinians to varying degrees compared to 29 percent of New Yorkers whose sympathies lie with Israelis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jeffries statement spoke about “keeping every New Yorker safe,” and he said he received an assurance “the Jewish community that has confronted a startling rise in antisemitic incidents,” along with Black and Latino neighborhoods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The endorsement simply acknowledges the shifting tides in the city and the party. Had he not endorsed Mamdani, Jeffries would have risked a primary challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, there’s the question of Andrew Cuomo. Jeffries’s mention of James was also a thinly-veiled swipe at Cuomo, who has refused to come to the attorney general’s defense.\n",
        "\n",
        "That’s because James not only targeted Trump: she released the report regarding Cuomo’s alleged sexual misconduct that led the governor to resign in disgrace. A Democratic politician like Jeffries whose main job in the House is to antagonize Trump can’t abide by that.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jeffries ended his statement by saying simply “I endorse the Democratic ticket” rather than saying he endorsed Mamdani. That shows he did not come to this endorsement as enthusiastically as say, Gov. Kathy Hochul. It’s rather his way of saying he’ll endorse Mamdani but not give his full support.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s a preview of a larger fight Jeffries will face in Washington should he become speaker: how does he balance protecting his vulnerable members while as handling an increasingly disgruntled left-wing flank that wants to aggressively fight Trump and push their own policy that frontliners may not favor.\n",

        "The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hakeem-jeffries], endorsed Zohran Mamdani [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani] for New York City mayor on Friday, ending a four-month standoff that left the Democratic nominee without the backing of one of the party’s most powerful figures until the day before early voting begins.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "The announcement arrives after months of pressure from progressives in Congress and after the top Democrat has been repeatedly grilled by reporters about his reluctance to support his party’s candidate.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy,” Jeffries wrote in a statement [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/nyregion/hakeem-jeffries-zohran-mamdani-endorsement.html].\n",
        "\n",
        "“In that spirit, I support him and the entire citywide Democratic ticket in the general election.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The Brooklyn representative’s delay has been particularly striking given that Mamdani, a democratic socialist, won the primary and Jeffries’s district decisively in June to defeat former governor Andrew Cuomo in what was considered a seismic upset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jeffries’s endorsement makes the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chuck-schumer], also of New York, the sole major Democratic congressional leadership holdout.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lack of earlier endorsements has not stopped the city’s magnetism for Mamdani, who maintains a commanding lead in polls for the 4 November general election, when he will face independent candidate Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jeffries’s extended hesitation stands in contrast with typical party unity timelines. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul [http://theguardian.com/us-news/kathy-hochul], assembly speaker Carl Heastie and senate majority leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins all have endorsed Mamdani, as have the New York representatives Jerry Nadler, Adriano Espaillat and Yvette Clarke – each of whom backed other candidates in the primary. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez] endorsed Mamdani before the primary, and has campaigned with him since.\n",
        "\n",
        "The minority leader has spent months deflecting questions from reporters, repeatedly instructing the media to “stay tuned” while insisting he had not refused to endorse, just that he “refused to articulate” his position. This hair-splitting did little to disguise what appeared to be profound discomfort with the 34-year-old democratic socialist whose upset primary victory upended the Democratic establishment’s expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "When pressed by CNBC [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR7-gbU1ye0] in August about the continued questioning on his Mamdani stance, a visibly frustrated Jeffries shot back: “I’m trying to understand why you would spend a significant amount of time asking me about the Democratic nominee who’s not even the mayor.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Jeffries, who raked in more than $1m from the pro-Israel lobby [https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary?code=Q05++&cycle=2024&ind=Q05++&mem=N&recipdetail=M] in 2023-2024, cited concerns about Mamdani’s past rhetoric on Israel and antisemitism, particularly the assembly member’s initial refusal to denounce the phrase “globalize the intifada”. Mamdani has also made the highly unlikely campaign promise to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/zohran-mamdani-benjamin-netanyahu-new-york] if he travels to New York.\n",
        "\n",
        "The House leader has also questioned how Mamdani would implement his progressive policies and combat gentrification in historically Black communities like those in Jeffries’s Brooklyn district. Some of the policies that Mamdani has advocated for include rent freezes, free city buses and municipal grocery stores, which have proven popular with the New York City electorate but have not been endorsed by party leaders like Jeffries, despite Democratic voters’ increasing demand for more fight and a clear identity opposed to Trump’s agenda.\n",
        "\n",
        "But the extended deliberation may also stem from political calculations: the leader is focused on recapturing the House majority in 2026, and some of his moderate battleground members view the progressive Mamdani as a potential liability.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process that finally yielded Friday’s endorsement included two in-person meetings in Brooklyn, with the civil rights leader Al Sharpton serving as a conduit between the two camps, anonymous sources tell Politico [https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/24/after-a-lengthy-wait-jeffries-to-endorse-mamdani-00621799].\n",
        "\n",
        "More recently, Jeffries appeared to soften his stance after Mamdani announced he would retain the popular New York police department commissioner, Jessica Tisch, a move the minority leader praised as “a positive step in the right direction”.\n",

        "Mr. Cuomo had a conversation with Mr. Trump about the race after losing the Democratic primary, according to three people briefed on the call.

        "Mr. Mamdani said on Thursday that Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Adams were too deferential to Mr. Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "''We know that in a moment when New Yorkers are looking for an answer to the authoritarianism that we're seeing from Washington, D.C., they don't want the continuation of making City Hall into an embassy of that same administration,'' Mr. Mamdani said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Adams said in the interview that he was worried that Mr. Mamdani's ideas were too extreme, pointing to his support for closing the Rikers Island jail complex -- mandated in a law passed by the City Council in 2019 -- reducing the jail population and disbanding the Police Department's ''strategic response group,\" which is often used to respond to protests.\n",
        "\n",
        "''I ran on a promise of making our city safe,'' Mr. Adams said, warning of electing a candidate ''that wants to decriminalize prostitution, that wants to empty out 3,000 dangerous inmates from Rikers to return back to the communities that they preyed on, a mayor that wants to divide the city on taxes based on ethnicity and run out high-income earners, that won't denounce 'globalize the intifada.'''\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani has called for raising taxes on wealthy residents and corporations to pay for his plans to make the city more affordable, and he has supported decriminalizing prostitution to allow the police to focus on violent crimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "He has shifted his position on the phrase ''globalize the intifada,'' which some view as a call for violence against Jews. On a podcast earlier this year, Mamdani declined to condemn the phrase, which he does not use; he later said it was not his job to police other people's language. He now says he would discourage people from using it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Adams and Mr. Cuomo are both moderate Democrats who share pro-business stances. They also have similar voting bases that have included Black voters and ultra-Orthodox Jewish voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two men were friends and political allies until Mr. Cuomo entered the Democratic primary for mayor in March, seizing on the mayor's sudden vulnerability. Mr. Adams has fiercely criticized Mr. Cuomo's record as governor, including his efforts to reform bail laws.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Cuomo, who is trying to win over moderate and conservative voters in the final weeks of the race, praised Mr. Adams after he ended his candidacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "''Both the mayor and myself are Democrats, and we do see Mamdani as an existential threat,'' Mr. Cuomo said in an interview with NY1. ''A person who's dangerously inexperienced who could hurt this city.''\n",
        "\n",
        "With early voting starting on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo has limited time to alter the trajectory of the race. Mr. Cuomo and his allies have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Sliwa, the Republican nominee, to drop out, but he has repeatedly refused.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Cuomo said during the debate that he would welcome an endorsement from Mr. Adams; Mr. Mamdani and Mr. Sliwa said they would decline one. Mr. Adams and Mr. Cuomo were soon seen shaking hands, smiling and giving thumbs-ups from the Knicks game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two key allies of the mayor have also recently endorsed Mr. Cuomo: Frank Carone, a top adviser to Mr. Adams, and Randy Mastro, the first deputy mayor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Speaking Thursday at a news conference outside a subway station, Mr. Sliwa, who is polling at about 15 percent, scoffed at the news of the endorsement, telling reporters that the two men were ''corrupt birds of a feather flocking together.'' He said that it was insincere for Mr. Adams to suddenly praise Mr. Cuomo.\n",

        "In a stunning political turn, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the city’s heated mayoral race, forming an unlikely alliance aimed at halting the rise of Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani. The endorsement, announced just weeks before Election Day, comes after Adams ended his re-election campaign following a primary loss to Mamdani. Once fierce adversaries, Adams previously called Cuomo “a snake and a liar,” but the two now present a united front, pledging to rally traditional Democratic voters and moderate New Yorkers who feel alienated by Mamdani’s progressive surge.From rivalry to reconciliationThe public thaw between Adams and Cuomo was confirmed when the pair appeared together courtside at the New York Knicks’ season opener. Their reunion surprised many political observers, given their history of sharp personal and ideological clashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "But with Mamdani leading in polls and early voting underway, both men appear to have found common ground in their mutual goal: preventing a left-wing takeover of City Hall.According to campaign insiders, Adams and Cuomo have agreed to coordinate outreach in key boroughs, especially in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, targeting Black, Latino, and working-class voters who have felt the brunt of rising rents and gentrification.Cuomo’s independent comebackAfter losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo entered the general election as an independent candidate, positioning himself as a seasoned, pragmatic alternative to both Mamdani and Republican contender Curtis Sliwa. His campaign has focused on law and order, economic stability, and criticism of what he calls “performative progressivism.”Despite past controversies surrounding his resignation as governor in 2021, Cuomo has steadily climbed in polls, now sitting in second place behind Mamdani. Analysts say Adams’ endorsement could help him close that gap by lending credibility among minority voters and centrist Democrats still loyal to the current mayor’s base.A calculated alliance against MamdaniFor Adams, the decision to back Cuomo is both strategic and symbolic. Mamdani’s populist message, built around rent freezes, free public transport, and city-run grocery stores, has resonated strongly with younger, immigrant, and working-class voters, cutting deep into the coalition that once powered Adams’ victory. By joining forces with Cuomo, Adams hopes to consolidate moderate voters who view Mamdani’s platform as too radical for New York’s fiscal and political reality.Political strategists note that this alliance also represents a shift in New York’s Democratic establishment. Once fractured by ideological battles, traditional party figures appear to be uniting under Cuomo to preserve institutional control amid the progressive wave.Mamdani’s response and the road aheadZohran Mamdani’s campaign has dismissed the Cuomo–Adams partnership as “political desperation,” arguing that it underscores the fear of change among career politicians. “This is a coalition of the status quo,” a campaign spokesperson said. “New Yorkers deserve leadership that represents working people, not backroom deals between former rivals.”Mamdani continues to dominate among foreign-born voters, renters, and younger demographics, while Cuomo’s support skews toward older and American-born New Yorkers. With less than two weeks until Election Day, early voting data suggests a competitive finish as both camps intensify door-to-door campaigning.\n",

        "Andrew Cuomo, former governor of New York State and independent candidate for mayor of the Big Apple, is grasping at straws to neutralize Zohran Mamdani, the progressive Democrat who leads all polls of voting intentions for the November 4 elections. Protagonist of a scandal of sexual harassment allegations of several female collaborators that removed him from power in 2021, he has received this Thursday the endorsement of the outgoing mayor, Eric Adams.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "The alderman, like Cuomo, is a Democrat turned independent, but as politically discredited as can only be the one who, to avoid a trial for corruption - he was formally charged with five crimes in September 2024 - pacts with the very enemy, President Donald Trump, to whom he offered his collaboration in the offensive against irregular immigration in the city. This is how he managed to have his case, which was to be tried last spring, dismissed. He also caresses a possible post in the Republican Administration -some point to the Embassy in Saudi Arabia- or, failing that, after today's announcement, a seat in a hypothetical city council governed by Cuomo.\n",
        "\n",
        "The incumbent mayor had already given Cuomo's candidacy a boost by withdrawing his candidacy on September 28 with a ten-point rise in the polls. Wednesday night's handshake between the two during the Knicks' home opener at Madison Square Garden formalized that somewhat poisoned endorsement, as Adams does not enjoy good press among New Yorkers. The former governor came to the arena from the television set where he faced off in the second and final debate against Mamdani and the third candidate in the race, non-MAGA Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sliwa has become a curious challenger, who marries no one, not even his party. He has rebuffed calls from prominent and influential Republicans, such as local businessmen John Catsimatidis and Sid Rosenberg, to step aside in favor of Cuomo, even going so far as to walk off a live radio show three days ago, on a station with which he was a contributor, when pressed about his withdrawal, \"I'd rather be impaled than work for Cuomo.\" \"There's nothing complicated about this. It's called democracy. The right of the people to vote. And the billionaires don't want the people to make this decision. I trust the people, not the political elite or the billionaires,\" he later explained on CNN. During Wednesday's debate, when asked if he would accept a hypothetical endorsement from Adams, Sliwa cried out to laughter from the audience, \"Good God no, that crook should be in jail.\" In recent weeks, in his umpteenth display of political inconsistency, the outgoing mayor had suggested he might endorse either Cuomo or Sliwa.\n",
        "\n",
        "The former governor of New York, who in addition to the allegations of harassment has another black spot on his resume (the management of the coronavirus in nursing homes, with a number of deaths significantly higher than officially recognized), only aspires to scratch votes and halt the rise of Mamdani, who in June won the Democratic primaries by surprise and forced him to reposition himself as an independent. In the absence of a solvent program, more focused on selling his successes as governor than on municipal policies to tackle, for example, the housing crisis, Cuomo is waving the support of businessmen and unions to prevent the candidate of the Democratic Socialist current from becoming, at 34 years of age, the next mayor of New York.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"We will have the best mayor money can buy, I'm afraid,\" Helen Grant, a member of an informal group called Grandmothers for Zohran, explained hours before the debate at a rally in Manhattan. \"It's the shake-up New York needs, but we all know how much millions and the pressures of those who have them can. That's why I don't see a Cuomo victory as impossible at all, even if all the polls favor Mamdani.\" Among the billionaires who at the request of the White House support Cuomo are Bill Ackman or Ronald Lauder.\n",
        "\n",
        "The former governor has turned on the fan to denounce Mamdani's alleged support for the \"globalization of the intifada\" and even \"global jihad\" (Mamdani is a Muslim), as well as the Democrat's criticism of Israel in Gaza, an issue that nearly monopolized the first debate; the request to defund the police, his poor performance as a state assemblyman -he was the second most absentee of the current legislature-, or, finally, his rapprochement with figures opposed to the LGTBIQ+ community, a movement of which Mamdani has made a banner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cuomo has especially criticized the front-runner's meetings with an influential conservative imam from Brooklyn or with the deputy prime minister of Uganda, the country where he was born and whose nationality he retains, who campaigned for years to criminalize gays and went so far as to call for the death penalty for them. \"Why don't you say 'I'm going to renounce my citizenship because I don't want to be a citizen of a country that would kill gays,'\" Cuomo spat at Mamdani recently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Trailing Mamdani in the polls by double digits, Adams' formal endorsement of Cuomo could backfire, as the mayor hit a historically low approval rating after his impeachment. Nor does his change of jacket help: in recent months, before his withdrawal, he had criticized Cuomo for pressuring him to drop out of the race, calling him a \"snake and a liar.\" Now he's backpedaling and supporting his one-time rival. \"I think it's imperative to bring awareness to black communities and other minorities who have suffered from gentrification about the importance of this race,\" Adams has said in justifying his pivot. \"They've seen their rents go up because of gentrification and they've been ignored in those neighborhoods, and I'm going to go to those neighborhoods and personally talk to their representatives, and I'm going to tour those neighborhoods with the [former] governor to get their buy-in.\" Three days before the start of early voting, this Saturday, it is already noted that they will campaign together, even though just a few weeks ago they disliked each other.\n",

        "\n",
        "But Cuomo and Adams clearly seemed to have mended relations on Wednesday night, when they sat together on the sidelines at the season opener of the New York Knicks, the city's basketball team - Cuomo, who is running as an independent, rushed to Madison Square Garden from Queens after the last debate of the race.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adams said on Thursday that he would campaign with Cuomo in neighborhoods where the mayor is most popular, and encourage people to vote for the former governor.\n",

        "There is no certainty about the ability of the mayor's support to significantly boost Cuomo's campaign - or even whether it could become a shot in the foot for the independent candidate.

        "\n",
        "Cuomo rose in the polls by 10 percentage points after the mayor left the race, suggesting that he channels the support of most of Adams' supporters. Even so, Cuomo's gap with Mamdani, a member of the state legislature and identified with the more left-wing wing of the Democratic party, is still in the double digits.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"I ran on a promise to make our city safe,\" Adams said, then listed a series of criticisms of Mamdani, including the refusal of Mamdani, who is Muslim, to condemn the slogan \"globalize intifida\" in a podcast earlier this year.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani changed his position on the phrase, which some see as a call to violence against Jews. Later, after the podcast in question, Mamdani said it was not his job to police other people's language. Now he says he would discourage people from using the slogan.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani was unavailable for comment when reached by the New York Times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adams and Cuomo are both moderate Democrats who share similar pro-business positions and have called for hiring more police officers. They also have similar voter bases that included black voters and ultra-Orthodox Jewish voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two were friends and political allies until Cuomo entered the race in March, taking advantage of the mayor's sudden vulnerability. Adams often criticized Cuomo's record as governor. Adams has also warred with the left wing of his party and sees Mamdani as a threat to his legacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cuomo, who is trying to win over moderate and conservative voters in the final weeks of the race, praised Adams and said he hoped the mayor was \"at peace with his decision\" to leave the race.\n",

        "\"Both the mayor and I are Democrats, and we see Mamdani as an existential threat,\" Cuomo said in an interview with NY1. \"A dangerously inexperienced person who could damage this city.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "With early voting starting on Saturday, Cuomo has limited time to change the electoral trend that gives Mamdani victory. The former governor and his allies have increased pressure on Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, to drop out, but he has repeatedly refused.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cuomo said during Wednesday's debate that he would welcome an endorsement from Adams; Mamdani and Sliwa said they would refuse. Adams and Cuomo were soon seen shaking hands, smiling and making positive signs at the Knicks game.\n",

        "Two key allies of the mayor have also recently endorsed Cuomo: Frank Carone, one of Adams' top advisors, and Randy Mastro, the first deputy mayor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sliwa, who has the support of around 15% of voters, made it clear in the final debate what he thought of Adams. \"Put this criminal in jail, where he belongs,\" said Sliwa.\n",

        "New York, Oct 23. (Adnkronos/Aki) - New York's outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, has officially announced that he will support former governor Andrew Cuomo in his electoral race for the November vote, hoping to slow the rise of Zohran Mamdani. The New York Times reported this. \"I think it is crucial to raise awareness among Black and Hispanic communities who have suffered from rising rents due to gentrification and have been ignored,\" Adams stated in the New York Times interview.\n",

        "Zohran Mamdani hosted a soccer tournament in Coney Island and he and Andrew Cuomo appeared at a forum at Queens College as the New York City mayoral campaign enters its final weeks.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Queens auditorium and a Brooklyn athletic field served as backdrops for New York City's mayoral campaign on Sunday, as Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo sought to shore up support among key constituencies and to rally their bases less than one week before early voting begins.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "Under the glare of field lights at Maimonides Park in Coney Island, Mr. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and front-runner, spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a soccer tournament his campaign hosted in partnership with a local league, NYC Footy. Dozens of teams, their players wearing jerseys color-coded by borough and bearing the Mamdani campaign's logo, competed on the field as fans wearing campaign-issued blue, white and orange scarves cheered them on from the stands.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assemblyman, himself a lifelong soccer fan, said the event, which his campaign called ''The Cost of Living Classic,'' was intended to draw attention to the high cost of living in New York. The tournament was also a way to bring his supporters together for a recreational activity before gearing up for a final blitz of canvassing. Early voting begins on Oct. 25.\n",
        "\n",
        "''Soccer is a big part of what so many New Yorkers love about being in this city,'' said Mr. Mamdani, who played the sport as a teenager. ''I think to have this opportunity to both celebrate the pride that we have in our own boroughs and our own city and also come together with those that we don't yet know, it's also a glimpse of what politics can be in this city.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Earlier in the day, Mr. Mamdani and Mr. Cuomo joined a gathering hosted by the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a nonpartisan, multifaith organizing group, which brought more than 2,000 community leaders to an auditorium at Queens College. Organizers described the event as designed to bring New York's most pressing policy issues into sharp focus in the final weeks of the campaign, and to extract commitments from both candidates on affordability, mental health resources and public housing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both men told the mostly Black and Latino audience that, if elected, they would make use of city-owned land to build affordable housing, a longtime goal of the foundation. In his remarks, Mr. Cuomo, who is running as an independent, singled out the gentrification that has displaced many of New York's residents of color.\n",
        "\n",
        "''We are destroying historically Black and brown communities because people can no longer afford to live in the community that they were raised,'' he said. ''When we build, there has to be a community preference for people to have those units.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Black voters are a key constituency whose support has long decided elections, particularly in Democratic cities. Mr. Cuomo performed well in predominantly Black areas during the June primary, while Mr. Mamdani lagged behind. But he has worked to make inroads in Black communities, including during forums like the one on Sunday, and has gained ground among Black voters, eking out a majority in recent polls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Cuomo's campaign rolled out several new initiatives before the gathering, including a ''South Asians for Cuomo'' organizing group and his plans to hire a chief innovation officer should he become mayor.\n",
        "\n",
        "The day followed a round of attacks on Mr. Mamdani from his critics. Mr. Cuomo's campaign criticized Mr. Mamdani for meeting with a well-known imam after a New York Post article on Saturday noted the imam's objection to homosexuality. Asked about the criticism during a news conference on Sunday, Mr. Mamdani, who is Muslim, said it amounted to Islamophobia.\n",
        "\n",
        "''The same imam met with Mayor Bloomberg, met with Mayor de Blasio, campaigned alongside Eric Adams, and the only time that it became an issue of national attention was when I met with him,'' he said. ''And that's because of the fact of my faith and because I'm on the precipice of winning this election.''\n",

        "Walking with Zohran Mamdani can feel like an extreme sport. During a mid-September stroll on Seventh Avenue, along the six blocks from his Manhattan campaign office to a favorite breakfast spot, he caused a noticeable amount of commotion, even in a city full of it. There was a selfie-seeking fan, then a campaign volunteer. A chance meeting with an old friend. Even a first-time encounter with the South African comedian Trevor Noah. He greeted Mamdani, who holds dual American and Ugandan citizenship, like the regional cousin he is. (After they embraced, Noah told the candidate he wanted him on his podcast.)\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "Amid the hubbub, I asked Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor, why he decided to run. By the time he could answer in full, we were waiting to be seated at Johny's Luncheonette, a testament to the obstacle course of interruptions that is currently his life. Mamdani favors the hole-in-the-wall Chelsea diner for its comfort food and low profile. Here, he can focus -- over his usual order of four scrambled eggs piled on toast with a single pancake on the side.\n",
        "\n",
        "''There was never going to be a poll that said, 'The time is now for Zohran Mamdani and a campaign on affordability,' '' he said, flashing his trademark full-face grin. ''I would often be asked this question: 'Are you running to win or running to run?' I would say that you can be doing both. You can be serious and determined and ruthless in your dedication to winning the race. And then, also, you can develop it.''\n",
        "\n",
        "The result has been historic. Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist backbench state assemblyman who before this year had almost no name recognition in New York City, is now the general-election favorite against a former governor and member of one of the most famous families in state politics. He has already shamed the incumbent mayor, who was running a distant fourth, into an early exit from the race.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the June primary, Mamdani didn't just beat the odds; he blew the door off the hinges, reshaping the electorate and taking advantage of ranked-choice voting to claim a commanding 12.8-point victory that reverberated through the country's politics.\n",
        "\n",
        "But what happened after the primary may turn out to be even more important. In the time since then, as this article was being reported, Mamdani has engaged in a second primary of sorts, meeting quietly with city power brokers to consolidate support and box out his main rivals, Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams. Some of it was reported. Much of it wasn't.\n",
        "\n",
        "For months now, Mamdani has been meeting privately with former leaders in city government, business executives, heads of New York arts and cultural institutions and skeptical local Democrats. The talks are pitched as get-to-know-you discussions with the new political star. But they also serve a dual purpose, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. In them, Mamdani has sought to present himself as a new type of leftist, a listener who understands his shortcomings and is willing to grow. He has acknowledged his lack of managerial experience and asked for advice. He has sought common ground. He has heard out his critics, including wealthy New Yorkers in business and finance and some pro-Israel activists who are turned off by his lifelong advocacy for Palestinians or offended by his reluctance to immediately condemn the phrase ''globalize the intifada,'' the use of which he later discouraged.\n",
        "\n",
        "There have been two critical liaisons: Patrick Gaspard, a former Obama administration aide and director of the Democratic National Committee, and Sally Susman, a longtime corporate executive and member of the finance committees for the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Gaspard met Mamdani years ago. Susman met him this summer, one of several C-suiters who privately reached out to him after his much-talked-about July meeting with the Partnership for New York City, a consortium of 350 members representing banks, law firms and corporations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Susman, who describes herself as a moderate pro-business Democrat, said she was impressed by how Mamdani handled himself amid the hostile crowd. Weeks later, she met with him for an hour, at her request, and said she left that interaction ''taken by'' his curiosity. She recalled that he asked questions like ''What do you know about game-changing leadership?'' and ''How should I form an administration?'' and made clear that there would be no ''litmus tests'' for staff roles in his cabinet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Susman has since become a valuable ally, convening two intimate gatherings at Mamdani's campaign office -- this time at his request -- for business leaders and tech investors eager to meet him. ''There's something about him that makes people want to help him,'' she told me.\n",
        "\n",
        "Robert Wolf, another Partnership for New York City member and a major fund-raiser for the Democratic Party, told me that he has begun texting with the candidate, becoming an informal pulse check for the city's finance and business community. Wolf also met with Mamdani for an hour at his campaign office this month, an in-person follow-up to an hourlong Zoom meeting in August.\n",
        "\n",
        "''Zohran, to me, is more of a progressive capitalist,'' Wolf told me, adding that he was convinced by their private interactions that Mamdani understood the importance of the private sector thriving in his New York. ''He's someone that wants to figure out how to use the government in an appropriate way on things that help equality and help the underserved.''\n",
        "\n",
        "The conversations have allowed Mamdani to reframe his previous positions, tweaking the us-versus-them language of his democratic-socialist values to be a tad less punitive. He has made it clear that he wants to support renters, not punish landlords. He wants to support public education, not take a hammer to specialized schools with elite admissions. He supports Palestinian rights; he's not anti-Zionist. He made key concessions when it comes to policing. Importantly, he made clear that he was open to compromise when it came to his proposed millionaires' tax. Call it Mamdani 2.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was an attempt to introduce a more mature left, focused on fulfilling its policy agenda rather than winning an ideological argument. Mamdani wants to be a good mayor -- a great mayor. And he wants to be judged on the criteria that he has set for himself: no-cost universal child care, free buses for all and a four-year rent freeze for the city's rent-stabilized apartments, the core planks of the affordability agenda that powered his primary campaign to victory. And he knows he can't do it by himself -- or with progressives alone. ''Being right in and of itself is meaningless,'' Mamdani told me when I asked about his approach to these meetings. ''We have to win. And we have to deliver.''\n",
        "\n",
        "The subtle shifts, even the rhetorical ones, have helped fortify his lead, to the point where his victory is all but assured. This was not a foregone conclusion on primary night, when many of the city's upper echelon -- the same people who have warmed to Mamdani in recent months -- had assumed that Cuomo or Adams would mount a bigger electoral challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "But Mamdani's lead has withstood constant attacks by his opponents, hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on negative advertisements and a full-on freak-out by the political establishment, including some Democrats who fear that he could be a useful wedge for Republicans, adversely affecting their swing-state candidates in next year's midterm congressional elections. He has been called an antisemite for his pro-Palestinian advocacy and given the nickname ''Mamdani the Commie'' by President Trump, who has said he will withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani is elected and baselessly suggested that Mamdani, a naturalized citizen, was in the country illegally.\n",
        "\n",
        "At one point, I asked how much he followed the discussion regarding the takeaways from his primary win and its impact on the national Democratic Party. ''I try not to spend too much time being engaged with the discourse of it all,'' he said, though it is hard to believe him.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a ''poster'' we're talking about, the millennial code word for someone who simply must share his thoughts on social media. The son of a celebrated filmmaker and an acclaimed academic who sought to start an indie rap career behind his mother's Disney movie. Politics is his second act -- an only-in-New York fairy tale that has captured the world's attention, given his roots in India and Uganda and the immigrant-rich nature of the city's electorate. And he has rewritten the rules for campaigning in the process, lapping opponents with an innovative digital strategy that has turned him into a bona fide internet celebrity in a signature suit and tie (he rotates three: one striped, one dotted, one red).\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani stands out further against a backdrop of Democratic Party failure. The party enters the second Trump era devoid of galvanizing leaders and meaningful policy ideas, largely rudderless and certainly visionless. In June, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that more than 60 percent of Democrats want fresh leadership, amid a wave of soul-searching and intraparty warfare that has been unleashed since the embarrassment of the 2024 election loss. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and Democratic Socialist who ran for president in 2016 and 2020, told me that Mamdani ''is running a brilliant grass-roots campaign.'' You would think, he continued, that Democrats ''would be jumping up and down with joy, saying: 'Thank god! This is the future of the Democratic Party!' Unfortunately, there are others who look at it differently.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Over five months of following the campaign, including two interviews with the candidate and conversations with about 40 other people close to the race and its reverberations among national Democrats, I didn't hear anyone express surprise that ''Z'' has almost pulled it off -- such was the total belief in his charisma.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani excels at the game of interpersonal politics that Sanders so famously eschews. He loves a rope line as much as Joe Biden. Loves a selfie like Elizabeth Warren. And he stays until the end of a Black church service, noting that the rhythms of the Haitian drums are reminiscent of the Congolese music he grew up with. At New York's West Indian American Day Parade this summer, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader -- who has still withheld his endorsement of the nominee -- made a pointed distinction between ''jerk-chicken Brooklyn'' and ''Starbucks Brooklyn.'' Mamdani moves easily through both.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet he increasingly feels the pressure of expectation, the natural consequence of the prospect of a weighty title: becoming the first Muslim mayor of New York City and one of the few elected officials in the country who is not just liberal or progressive but unapologetically leftist. Mamdani told me he understands that his success or failure will not be seen as only his own. He is right.\n",
        "\n",
        "When I asked if there was a part of the city that had surprised him during the campaign, an experience or a neighborhood that inspired his connection to the city all over again, Mamdani took a beat to reflect. He can be prone to long pauses that can feel like a bit more of an awkward silence than a moment of building suspense.\n",
        "\n",
        "More than 20 seconds later, he had an answer: during Ramadan, in March.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani told me he tried to ''attend as many new prayers and gatherings as possible.'' Not just going to one celebration of Chand Raat, or ''night of the moon,'' the traditional South Asian festival, but as many as he could -- ''getting in that moment,'' he said, ''a snapshot of Muslim life across New York City.''\n",
        "\n",
        "His answer reminded me of just how different a candidate he is. Mamdani has placed his faith, his Indian-Ugandan roots and his pro-Palestinian activism at the center of the campaign, trusting the public to understand his vision and values even if the traditional gatekeepers did not. ''I've met so many grandparents who've come up to me and said, 'My grandkid told me if I don't vote for you, then you can't come home,' '' he said, proud of the generational revolution he has inspired. ''This redefinition of leadership,'' he continued, ''and the place of youth within our politics -- it's not just a question about me; it's a question about New Yorkers themselves.''\n",
        "\n",
        "At that moment, I better understood the outsize reactions to Mamdani's rise -- among the people used to having power and money and among some in Democratic Party leadership. It's not just what Mamdani believes in. Or that he was increasingly likely to occupy City Hall. It's that he may have the temperament -- and the public support -- to sustain his political coalition past January's inauguration and effect meaningful change to policy and legislation. Stardom is not what's inherently threatening. Combining it with competence is.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be clear: Nobody asked Zohran Mamdani to run for mayor. Not the Democratic Socialists of America. Not the city's progressive donor base. Not the Working Families Party, the institutional home of the city's left wing. Mamdani hatched this plan himself early last year, at Qahwah House in Astoria, a Yemeni coffee shop that served as his local hide-out and unofficial scheming headquarters just blocks from his apartment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 2021 mayoral election, won by Eric Adams, had humbled New York's left, as had the backlash to progressive causes like ''defund the police'' and the elimination of cash bail. But Mamdani saw an opportunity to form a coalition built from his own life and convictions: Muslims, South Asians, renters, young people and progressives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over cups of creamy spiced mofawar, Mamdani made the case to allies, interest-group leaders and, not least, the D.S.A. ''One of the beautiful things about going through a D.S.A. endorsement process is that it's a microcosm of the larger race,'' Mamdani said, explaining that most ''political processes are coronations or predetermined.'' Not this one.\n",
        "\n",
        "The socialist group takes pride in its grueling endorsement process and bottom-up structure, meant to ensure that elected officials are committed to core values or face the wrath of rank-and-file members. D.S.A. leadership did not expect to support any candidate in the 2025 mayoral race, favoring an electoral strategy that focused on lower-level races.\n",
        "\n",
        "''I had to rely on my own conviction and the conviction of those who mattered around me, no matter what the response was,'' he continued. ''And having gone through all of that before entering the larger race meant that we were steeled.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani's relationships with the D.S.A. and other allies go back a decade or more. He joined the D.S.A. after he was inspired by Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign, which led to a longstanding connection with New York City's housing organizers and activists, informing his policy focus of making the city more affordable for its residents. He was already a member of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, where he connected with a growing network of Muslim and South Asian voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "But there was one issue that was most formative to Mamdani's political identity, the one he knew he would never compromise on: Israel and Palestinians. Mamdani's pro-Palestinian advocacy dates to his high school days at Bronx Science, when he furiously traded Facebook posts with a pro-Israel classmate, and continued at Bowdoin College, where he founded the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine.\n",
        "\n",
        "He told me these early experiences taught him the difference between seeing politics as an intellectual debate and a consequence of people's lived experience. It also fueled his impatience with a worldview that he describes as ''PEP'' -- or ''progressive except Palestine'' -- a coinage that has been used on the left for years.\n",
        "\n",
        "''That exception is one that I believe we should not only take issue with because of what it means for Palestinians and Palestinian human rights,'' he said. ''But also, whenever you are at peace with the making of an exception, you make it easier to make another exception -- wherever, whenever.''\n",
        "\n",
        "This defiant certitude was reflected in Mamdani's campaign from the outset. He was convinced that the city's diverse coalition of renters could unite behind an affordability agenda, even though polling encouraged a focus on public safety. He understood that many of the city's immigrant communities were both underserved by the government and electoral resources that hadn't been tapped. And over the last year, Americans' views on Israel have drawn much closer to Mamdani's than to Senator Chuck Schumer's -- perhaps the most establishment figure of all in New York -- turning what was once assumed to be a political liability into a pillar of his truth-telling, anti-establishment credentials. In 2023, just days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Mamdani was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct as he protested outside Schumer's home -- telling reporters at the time that Israel's retaliatory campaign could risk ''imminent genocide.''\n",
        "\n",
        "''None of this works without him speaking up on Gaza,'' said Gaspard, the former Obama administration aide, who likened it to Barack Obama's opposition to the Iraq war before the 2008 presidential election. Gaspard has been a key figure connecting Mamdani with many of the city's power players in the months since the primary, including Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.\n",
        "\n",
        "''For average people on the ground, having conversations in their barbecues or on their stoops, there's a way that the issue of Gaza is a gateway to whether or not you can invite this political figure into your living room for a conversation about affordability or education or health care,'' Gaspard said, citing new polling that shows growing disapproval of Israel's actions among Democrats. ''You don't get to first base on the other things if you haven't come out of the batter's box on Gaza.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Gaspard first met Mamdani in South Africa in 2016, at the premiere for ''Queen of Katwe,'' a Disney movie set in Uganda and directed by Mamdani's mother, Mira Nair. Gaspard said the young man, just 24 at the time, showed flashes of the charisma that would later serve his entrance into politics. He compared the curiosity and demeanor of young Mamdani to that of -- yes -- Barack Obama. But Mamdani's is a story that, like that of many other first-generation immigrants, doesn't fit neatly into American political conventions like the two-party system or our Black-white racial framework. A composite of multiple worlds: Indian, Ugandan, American, Muslim, New Yorker.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani told me that his Muslim faith, in particular, ''has been a formative part of how I see the world -- and how the world sees me,'' particularly after the crackdown on mosques and the uptick in Islamophobia that came in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani said he remembers once telling his father, a professor of international affairs and anthropology at Columbia, that he was exhausted with ''always feeling like a minority.'' But his father's reply changed his perspective. ''I was an Indian in Uganda. I was a Muslim in India. And I was all of these things in New York City,'' Mahmood Mamdani explained to his son. And ''to be a minority is also to see the truth of the place amidst the promise of it.''\n",
        "\n",
        "''It was this moment which took me from a view of the world where I had this chip on my shoulder,'' Mamdani told me, ''to one which made me understand instead both what the world took -- and what it offered.''\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how Mamdani talks: in parables. He leans close and locks eyes. He collapses the room with held eye contact. He sprinkles in references to World Cup soccer and the English Premier League, as he knows I'm a fan of Tottenham Hotspur (Mamdani supports its rival club, Arsenal). He is one of the few politicians I can remember who sat for a 30-minute interview without a press person at hand and didn't even bother recording themselves. Sanders was another.\n",
        "\n",
        "No wonder both thrive in the male-dominated, bro-heavy digital podcast space. Mamdani has appeared on Pablo Torre's show (sports), ''Throwing Fits'' (fashion), Bloomberg's ''Odd Lots'' (finance) -- maybe the holy digital-media trinity for the millennial New York man. He has done ''The View,'' the ''I've Had It'' podcast and Hasan Piker's popular Twitch stream, traversing the gamut of liberal-leftist media. On TikTok, he did a viral interview with Crackhead Barney -- the New York performance artist and comedian who bombarded him with questions like ''Would you claim African American status like Elon Musk?'' The candidate answered each query earnestly, even the ridiculous ones, seemingly familiar with the bit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ritchie Torres, the Bronx Democrat and frequent critic of progressives, said Mamdani is ''a once-in-a-generation communicator'' who has mastered what he called the ''three threes'': A candidate in today's day and age needs to be able to explain ideas in a 30-second vertical social media video, a three-minute television hit and a three-hour long-form podcast.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering their ideological differences, which are particularly stark when it comes to Israel (Torres is a staunch defender), I asked why the congressman had been so complimentary of Mamdani publicly and privately.\n",
        "\n",
        "His answer spoke to the effectiveness of the Mamdani charm offensive and the eternal fact that all elected officials trade on the currency of attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "''Simple,'' Torres said. ''He reached out to me.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Morris Katz, Mamdani's senior adviser, told me that among the most important meetings of the campaign was its very first one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani was presented with polling that represented the conventional wisdom of the time -- that public safety was the top concern among voters -- and he instinctively dismissed it. This was going to be a campaign about affordability, he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "''People have given up on the city government's ability to deliver on affordability and lowering costs, and what we're seeing is that lack of faith,'' Katz remembers Mamdani saying at the time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani told me that his vision drew from his own experiences. The D.S.A. came after he volunteered for Ali Najmi, a civil rights lawyer and member of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York who was running for City Council. Najmi connected Mamdani with the group, and Mamdani later worked for Khader El-Yateem, a Palestinian American Lutheran pastor who was running for City Council in 2017.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both campaigns created a model for Mamdani that he would implement citywide eight years later. They focused on housing, particularly the crisis for renters that had been accelerated by gentrification. Perhaps most significant was that El-Yateem did not seek to moderate his position on Israel and the Palestinians, saying he ''100 percent'' supported the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and campaigning with Linda Sarsour, the D.S.A. member and Palestinian American activist who has been accused of antisemitism.\n",
        "\n",
        "But the thing about the campaigns that Mamdani worked on is that they all lost. What the comparison reveals is that his current electoral success springs not only from his values but also from his unique traits as a candidate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani calls himself a Democrat, something many on the left (Sanders included) do not. In his hands, the cry of ''gentrification'' has become a focus on affordability, a more welcoming umbrella that tracks with his growing willingness to acknowledge a private-sector role in building more housing units. There is no Linda Sarsour on his campaign trail.\n",
        "\n",
        "This willingness to temper his previous positions and allegiances, which Mamdani has proved since the primary, is what sets him apart from some leftist contemporaries, said Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president and the Democratic nominee for city comptroller. Levine contrasted Mamdani's modus operandi with the governing style of Democratic mayors past, including Bill de Blasio, a progressive who racked up enemies through petty slights and misjudged moments, even as he shared many of Mamdani's populist goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "After Mamdani won the Democratic primary, his campaign compiled a list of the city's top business leaders and called each of them one by one, underscoring his desire to build coalitions and establish an open line of communication. ''I want to emphasize how unprecedented this is -- the first nominee in memory that has made a concerted effort to reach out to people who were against him in the primary,'' Levine told me.\n",
        "\n",
        "Among New York's progressives, no one has forgotten the cautionary tale of how de Blasio effectively lost the New York Police Department in his first term. The fraught relationship plummeted to a nadir after the killing of two officers in late 2014, when the police turned their backs on the mayor at the hospital and then at the funerals.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the George Floyd protests of June 2020, Mamdani posted on Twitter: ''We don't need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.''\n",
        "\n",
        "But since the primary, Mamdani has repeatedly distanced himself from those statements, saying he would apologize to the Police Department if elected. He has gone even further in private, recently meeting with more than two dozen rank-and-file police officers in a closed-door session focused on officer retention and public safety. There, Mamdani explicitly apologized for the June 2020 tweet, a spokeswoman said. He has also spoken approvingly of Jessica Tisch, the current police commissioner, who is well liked by city institutions and the rank and file. In our interview, Mamdani stressed that his praise for Tisch was ''sincere'' and that he was considering keeping her on as commissioner.\n",
        "\n",
        "I asked Mamdani how sincere could he be, considering that Tisch has been clear that she is opposed to criminal-justice reforms supported by most progressives.\n",
        "\n",
        "''There is -- and has to be -- room for disagreement among those at the core of your City Hall,'' Mamdani said in response. He said one of his staffing goals as mayor would be to ensure that the people around him ''are not characterized by the quickness with which they can say yes to any one of your ideas.'' This is also a theme that Mamdani has stressed in private, telling Susman he believed in a ''team of rivals.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the summer, Mamdani faced his first crisis related to public safety -- when he was in Uganda, celebrating his wedding to Rama Duwaji, a 27-year-old illustrator, with family and friends.\n",
        "\n",
        "On July 28, a gunman strode into a Park Avenue office tower and opened fire, killing four people, including two security guards, one of whom was an off-duty police officer. Soon after the news became public, Cuomo and Adams began to point the finger at Mamdani -- because he was out of the country, but also to highlight his previous stances on public safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "What happened next surprised everyone. That off-duty officer, Didarul Islam, was a Bangladeshi American Muslim and had actually been at the same mosque as Mamdani during the candidate's tour of Eid services. And once Mamdani rushed back to the United States, after he was awakened by Katz's 4 a.m. call, he went directly from Kennedy Airport to the family's home in the Bronx, where he visited with the mourners for an hour. Later that day, he delivered a stirring rebuke to Cuomo and Adams, whom he accused of trying to score ''cynical political points'' rather than supporting the family. Standing with the co-founder of the Bangladeshi American Police Association, Mamdani made clear that he would not be intimidated by the soft-on-crime attacks that have doomed so many other progressives. If the tragic event was a grim sort of mayoral pop quiz, the candidate seemed to pass it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Which is why his repeated promise to order the Police Department to arrest the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, if he were to come to New York City while Mamdani was mayor, has confounded several of Mamdani's allies -- and fed his enemies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani has said he would be honoring the warrant issued by the International Criminal Court charging Netanyahu with crimes against humanity in Gaza. But the United States does not recognize the authority of the I.C.C., and legal experts regard such an arrest as most likely illegal. More to the point, the act could prompt something like a constitutional crisis with the Police Department. Trump has already promised that he would intercede.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arresting Netanyahu is also not a primary goal of Mamdani's leftist base. When I asked Gustavo Gordillo, who leads the New York City chapter of the D.S.A., about what he sees as Mamdani's nonnegotiable campaign promises, he named the affordability agenda. I asked Murad Awawdeh, who leads the New York Immigrant Coalition and knows Mamdani from the Muslim Democratic Club, if arresting Netanyahu was important to him as a Palestinian. He said no.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of Mamdani's Jewish supporters warn that an arrest attempt would permanently fracture the bonds he has painstakingly sought to form. Brad Lander, the city comptroller and former mayoral candidate, who was a key validator and an ally in liberal Jewish communities, shrugged off the candidate's promise to arrest Netanyahu, refusing to comment on the record. What's important, Lander said, is a different promise Mamdani made on the night of the primary, when he said: '''I am going to reach out and listen and try to understand.' And he has more than lived up to that commitment.'' Lander recalled sitting with Mamdani as a group of Orthodox Jews described being called antisemitic slurs on the street. ''He was just a very human, empathetic listener,'' he said, ''and in that case just communicated clearly that he thought that was awful.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Representative Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic stalwart who endorsed Mamdani in June and is considered a more mainstream Jewish voice than Lander, said he believes that the pledge to arrest Netanyahu is ''simply unrealistic.'' He continued: ''The City of New York has no jurisdiction to do such a thing,'' though, he added, ''I appreciate the sensibility behind'' the candidate's statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Still, Mamdani is resolute, even though it's a campaign promise that is likely to be tested. Netanyahu, like Trump, is prone to provocation and could very well arrive in New York next year simply to call the new mayor's bluff.\n",
        "\n",
        "On our walk back from the luncheonette, Mamdani stood by his promise -- again. ''It is important that New York City is in compliance with international criminal law,'' he said firmly.\n",
        "\n",
        "I asked how this stance fit alongside the other things he had said to me: that his only goal was to deliver on buses and rent, that he knew his administration would be judged at a higher standard, that it bothered him when politicians did not focus on policies that effect material change.\n",
        "\n",
        "But by now we were approaching his campaign office, stuck in a crammed Manhattan service elevator with a very large security guard. With my time running out, the candidate made his response quick, signaling that this interview was now over.\n",
        "\n",
        "''Is this a campaign promise that's compatible with governing?'' I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "''We're going to show how it is,'' he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "For better or worse, a remarkable number of the Democratic Party's most influential figures currently live in New York. Schumer and Jeffries, both of Brooklyn, lead their respective caucuses in Congress. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of the Bronx, is the party's most famous progressive and a possible presidential candidate in 2028. Mamdani has already positioned himself among this echelon, pushing his way into a struggle that is not just ideological but generational.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most New York Democrats have now endorsed Mamdani, including the Albany elected officials most critical to his agenda, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Speaker Carl Heastie, as well as Nadler, who is retiring from the House, and Yvette Clarke, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even some of the most towering national Democrats, including Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris, have made congratulatory calls to Mamdani -- and they wanted everyone to know it, making clear they recognized the enthusiasm he inspired even if they disagreed with some of his stances and policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The establishment's embrace has only made the actions -- or rather inaction -- of Jeffries, Schumer and other Mamdani holdouts, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, stand out even more. Jeffries and Schumer have been vague, refraining from endorsing Mamdani after the primary but also not exactly refusing to. Representative Tom Suozzi, a swing-district Democrat who represents parts of eastern Queens and Long Island, has made clear that Mamdani will never receive his endorsement, saying that ''Democratic Socialists should create their own party, because I don't want that in my party.''\n",
        "\n",
        "This tension was on full display at a fascinating moment I witnessed in August at the West Indian American Day Parade breakfast in Brooklyn, an annual fund-raising event that is a go-to stop on the summer schedule for all New York Democrats. There, I approached Jeffries and asked for an interview about Mamdani and the broader mayor's race. He agreed and pointed me toward his political staff, who later affirmed that he would be interested in talking.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the breakfast, Jeffries was in the middle of speaking, hammering on the economic chaos sown by Trump's tariffs and the Medicaid cuts in the recent spending package passed by the Republican-led Congress -- standard Democratic fare. But when Mamdani arrived, the immediate jolt of excitement was such that even Jeffries could not ignore it. Cameras flashed, people rushed for selfies and some of the reporters huddled around Jeffries fled for Mamdani instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a visual representation of how quickly Jeffries, the Brooklyn congressman handpicked by Nancy Pelosi to succeed her as House speaker and lead Democrats into the future, already seems as if he has missed his moment.\n",
        "\n",
        "A month later, Jeffries still didn't seem to have a clear idea about how to handle Mamdani. ''I just haven't weighed in one way or the other,'' Jeffries said about the mayor's race during an appearance on Don Lemon's YouTube show in September. Schumer has said less, signaling through advisers that while he likes Mamdani personally, he is worried about the effect an endorsement could have on Senate candidates in the midterms (there's also that 2023 arrest while protesting outside Schumer's home). Gillibrand had to call Mamdani and apologize after she falsely claimed he had made ''references to global jihad.''\n",
        "\n",
        "I never did get to talk with Jeffries about Mamdani. Several phone calls to his team soon turned to voice mail messages that went unanswered. In October I told Jeffries's staff that I would have to write that he avoided talking about Mamdani for months. There was still no response. Schumer and Gillibrand each declined an interview request.\n",
        "\n",
        "Endorsements rarely have a tangible impact in an election. But they are a leading indicator of a candidate's standing within his party, and the fact that so many national Democratic figures have refrained from embracing Mamdani speaks to a moment of real reckoning for the party. Mamdani has galvanized the exact voters who turned away from Democrats in 2024: working-class people of color, young people and first-generation Americans. But whether his playbook is adopted more broadly is one of political will. ''Millionaire taxes poll extremely well,'' Heastie said while endorsing Mamdani this year. Criticizing Israel polls just as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Which is why what's most interesting about the Jeffries-Mamdani relationship (or the lack of one) is what's beneath it. Mamdani won Jeffries's congressional district by around 12 points, about the same margin as his overall victory. And he did so without the blessing of traditional Democratic gatekeepers, bringing new voters to the process of expanding the electorate: the exact same political strategy Sanders sought to accomplish in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to a recent data analysis of the primary by Gothamist, 7 percent of New York City primary voters were first-time registrants in 2025, up five points from the Democratic election four years earlier, amounting to 76,860 first-time voters out of 1,071,730 total, with a majority in the age group of 18 to 34 and in districts won by Mamdani. What all this means is that the city has changed, and its Democratic politics are changing with it, in ways that could portend shifting alliances across the country.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both Jeffries and Schumer are also facing the prospect of left-wing primary challengers in the coming election cycles. Ocasio-Cortez could run for president in 2028 or mount a primary challenge to Schumer, with Mamdani as a likely ally in either run. Jeffries has a more immediate concern, considering that he's up for re-election next year and Brooklyn's Mamdani fever is especially hot in his district. Chi Ossé, a City Council member from Brooklyn and early Mamdani endorser, is one possible challenger. Another is Jabari Brisport, a state senator who is a member of the D.S.A. and a close friend of Mamdani's.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the city's old guard, Jeffries's antipathy for the D.S.A. is not without merit. For years, the organization represented the worst of the so-called Bernie Bro -- overwhelmingly white, male and in possession of a degree from an elite school that they would be happy to tell you about. They posted about politics and rarely participated in the actual messy work of it. Even some of the group's own members, like State Senator Julia Salazar, the first D.S.A. member elevated to Albany in 2018, said that the organization has grown from its past and that Mamdani has shown how, with the right candidate, the organizational model can be deployed beyond its original base.\n",
        "\n",
        "But that expansion is not without growing pains -- and electoral risk. During this mayoral campaign, Mamdani has faced criticism from the left, for maybe the first time in his electoral career. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators have disrupted his events, critical of his position that Israel has a right to exist. And he is increasingly cast as a sellout by some on leftist social media.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gordillo, the co-chairman of the city chapter, told me that he expects a Mamdani mayoralty to showcase the organization's maturation, just as the primary did. So I ran through a list of hypotheticals of Mamdani in office: What if he keeps Jessica Tisch as police commissioner? What if he doesn't back D.S.A. primary challengers against Democratic incumbents?\n",
        "\n",
        "When I first spoke to Gordillo, he said he could see a world in which none of those Mamdani reversals would be a clear red line with the D.S.A. left. But weeks later, as the prospect of Tisch staying on seemed to grow more real, Gordillo said that would be more of a problem -- reflecting the potential tension between Mamdani the mayor and the uncompromising base that helped get him elected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another thing Gordillo made clear: He did not want Mamdani to abandon his call for a millionaires' tax.\n",
        "\n",
        "''Supporting a millionaires' tax and supporting taxing the rich is something we all want and expect,'' Gordillo said. ''To back off on taxing the rich would be to change the kind of project we're pursuing.'' I pointed out that Mamdani has already shown signs of being flexible on the tax, telling me that ''it's more important what we fund than how.''\n",
        "\n",
        "''If there was magically federal funding for all the things that he wanted, that would be a conversation,'' Gordillo responded. ''That's just so out of the realm of what anyone expects.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike Gordillo, Mamdani calls himself a Democrat. But that doesn't mean he agrees with Jeffries's position that Democratic primary challengers are distractions to the job at hand: a united opposition to Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "''I see the next several years as an opportunity to fulfill the agenda,'' Mamdani said when I asked if he would consider endorsing a primary challenger to a Democratic incumbent. ''And I think the possibility of delivering on these political commitments in a material way is something that cannot only transform our political reality but also people's relationship to politics.'' It wasn't really an answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "I tried again. ''Is the moment ever coming where you'll put the D.S.A. at arm's length and say, 'I'm a Democrat now'?''\n",
        "\n",
        "At that moment, our server arrived, giving Mamdani an opportunity to take another one of his signature pauses. He then asked me to clarify the question, and I asked whether he would ever back a Democratic incumbent over a D.S.A. challenger.\n",
        "\n",
        "''The conditions within which I accept and make endorsements are on the basis of the agenda that I'm running on,'' he said deliberately, and then brought the point home. ''I have an openness to working with anyone to achieve that agenda.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani's embrace of mass politics could reinvigorate the Democrats' left wing. Since Biden's 2020 victory, that side of the party had gone quiet, such was the establishment capture among Democrats over the last several years. Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, once critical voices, were key validators for the Biden White House on domestic economic policy and climate change. Ocasio-Cortez -- far and away the Democrats' most important millennial voice -- defended Biden's re-election bid after his disastrous debate performance. Ocasio-Cortez also did not respond to several requests for comment. (Like Jeffries, her staff indicated several times that she would be open to speaking -- and several messages then went unanswered.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Adriano Espaillat, the Dominican American congressman who originally backed Cuomo before endorsing Mamdani, told me that the generational and political divide Mamdani has highlighted in Black and Jewish communities also applies to Latinos. He said that Cuomo was a ''familiar name'' in his district but that Mamdani has something more valuable -- fresh ideas.\n",
        "\n",
        "The disruption has also caused some concern. Some Democrats fear that the rising tide of immigration, including South Asians, Latinos and first-generation Americans, could displace their own political power within the party. And scores of local elected officials refused to talk about Mamdani and the impact of the changing alliances, including Representative Gregory Meeks, a Queens Democrat and head of the Congressional Black Caucus's political-action committee, who has also declined to endorse Mamdani; and Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate in the primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "With their silence, they reveal the left's ultimate advantage in this period of upheaval. Political triangulation runs dangerously close to inauthenticity, but it has been the model for most mainstream Democratic candidates since Obama made the Clintonian posture his own in 2008. But separated from its unique candidate, and the myth that Trump was an aberration, Obama-ism has been exposed, leaving the Democratic establishment in a frantic search for a Plan B.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's a place that is all too reminiscent of where Republicans were about a decade earlier, after Obama's re-election revealed a chasm between the interests of party leaders and its working-class base. The 2016 election was approaching. We all know what happened next.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani and I are both fans of European soccer, the kind who will set an alarm at 7 a.m. to watch a team halfway across the world inevitably disappoint us week after week. It's why I was vaguely aware of him outside of politics before the mayoral run -- I knew he liked Arsenal (and he tweeted about it). But it's also why I knew that this September afternoon in Brooklyn meant so much to him, as he sat in a Fort Greene bar called FancyFree watching Arsenal with Spike Lee, maybe the only famous New Yorker who loves the team as much as he does.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over 30 minutes of game time, the two made fast friends as they writhed in agony, banged the wall in frustration and helped lead the bar in Arsenal chants. (Lee was seemingly peeved that I had been invited by Mamdani's team to join them and made clear to me that he was there only to watch soccer, not to talk politics to a reporter). When the half ended, patrons serenaded Mamdani on his way out, chanting the candidate's name to the tune of ''Seven Nation Army'' -- the universal soccer sign of approval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani has made this kind of celebrity encounter a feature of his campaign. He has appeared at concerts by Wu-Tang Clan at Madison Square Garden and Lucy Dacus. Emily Ratajkowski, the model, actress and social media celebrity, posted an Instagram video on the day of the primary of herself standing with Mamdani and wearing a ''Hot Girls For Zohran'' T-shirt. The video got more than 300,000 likes.\n",
        "\n",
        "This blend of culture and politics was always part of the plan drawn up over coffee at Qahwah House, when Mamdani stressed that any successful candidacy would require a social media movement. He was Mira Nair's son after all, raised with an understanding of how storytelling can shape political reality. During his time in the State Assembly, he studied people like Ocasio-Cortez and Ossé, the City Council member who is popular on TikTok, reaching out to learn about their social media strategy in an effort to create his own. It required a pivot, a step away from the condensation of X to platforms like YouTube and Instagram reels, where the tone and format were a better match for political organizing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani's digital operation, led by the creative director Andrew Epstein, has been a prized part of the campaign from its early stages, when the return on investment was immediately clear: In one of the first videos, Mamdani explained the rising food costs for halal trucks in New York City (''halalflation''), and it racked up more than 360,000 views on YouTube alone, driving home the organic audience the message was finding online.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani says his political imagination is born out of necessity. To deliver on his promised agenda and maintain the first-of-its-kind coalition that has brought him to the doorstep of power, Mamdani will test the limits of his political capital, even with the help of more than four million Instagram followers and an extensive volunteer operation. ''Politics is not something that they must simply have,'' Mamdani said. ''It's something that they must do.''\n",
        "\n",
        "''We have brought so many to politics for the first time in a long time, and there's a responsibility that you don't waste that hope,'' he continued. ''You don't get a second chance in convincing someone that they have a place in the politics of our city and our country.''\n",
        "\n",
        "After Lee and Mamdani posed for photos, I joined the candidate on his drive uptown, as he hurried to make it to the African American Day Parade in Harlem, the annual event along Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. The last time I interviewed him, earlier in September, we parted hours before the news broke that the conservative activist Charlie Kirk had been shot and killed in Utah, reigniting discussions about America's deep polarization and the violence it begets.\n",
        "\n",
        "This time, Kirk's death was where I wanted to start, considering that Mamdani lives a similarly public life. Mamdani said that the killing was ''horrific'' and that he learned about it on social media, where he, like many others, was served a graphic video of the disturbing moment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The shooting, he told me, was ''illustrative of the fabric of this country coming apart at the seams and this being a moment where we are really staring into the abyss.'' Mamdani added that he worries more for ''the people around me'' than himself -- and that his team had made some changes to his security protocols in response to the shooting.\n",
        "\n",
        "''Really?'' I asked. ''You don't see that and worry about yourself?''\n",
        "\n",
        "I wondered because the prospect of violence was something Mamdani's allies had worried openly about to me, invoking the concerns that many Black voters had about Obama's historic run in 2008.\n",
        "\n",
        "''I try not to,'' he said. But just the previous week, a Texas man was charged with making death threats against Mamdani and his family, saying he wanted to ''see an I.D.F. bullet go through'' Mamdani's skull.\n",
        "\n",
        "''I think for a long time, it's felt as if the safest place, especially as a Muslim in public life, was to be in the shadows,'' Mamdani said. ''And yet we see that that safety is all too tenuous. And to allow ourselves to be intimidated is to, in some ways, allow for the continuation of that very kind of politics.''\n",
        "\n",
        "The conversation turned to the aftermath of Kirk's killing, specifically ABC's decision to take the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air in response to complaints by Trump and conservative activists. Mamdani denounced the decision, and the next day he would pull out of a scheduled town hall with a local ABC affiliate, helping to kick off a wave of boycotts that helped get Kimmel reinstated.\n",
        "\n",
        "''The story of Trump's authoritarianism cannot be told without the cowardice of so many institutions across this country,'' Mamdani told me. He then offered some advice for those institutional leaders, for the Democratic Party, for the public.\n",
        "\n",
        "''If you want to defeat this attack on our city and our values and our people,'' he said, ''the most effective way to do so is to fight back. It's not to acquiesce.''\n",

        "\n",
        "Last week, leaders of 32BJ and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council — both of which have endorsed Mamdani in the general election — joined City Council leaders to proclaim their fierce opposition to the proposals, stressing that they would weaken workers’ hand in reaching labor agreements with developers. So did the District Council of Carpenters, which endorsed Cuomo in the primary but has not made a decision for the general.\n",

        "But Mamdani is not only counting on the unions’ support to help get elected. If he wins, he will need the City Council to help him govern.

        "Walking with Zohran Mamdani can feel like an extreme sport. During a mid-September stroll on Seventh Avenue, along the six blocks from his Manhattan campaign office to a favorite breakfast spot, he caused a noticeable amount of commotion, even in a city full of it. There was a selfie-seeking fan, then a campaign volunteer. A chance meeting with an old friend. Even a first-time encounter with the South African comedian Trevor Noah. He greeted Mamdani, who holds dual American and Ugandan citizenship, like the regional cousin he is. (After they embraced, Noah told the candidate he wanted him on his podcast.)\n",

        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "Amid the hubbub, I asked Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor, why he decided to run. By the time he could answer in full, we were waiting to be seated at Johny’s Luncheonette, a testament to the obstacle course of interruptions that is currently his life. Mamdani favors the hole-in-the-wall Chelsea diner for its comfort food and low profile. Here, he can focus — over his usual order of four scrambled eggs piled on toast with a single pancake on the side.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There was never going to be a poll that said, ‘The time is now for Zohran Mamdani and a campaign on affordability,’ ” he said, flashing his trademark full-face grin. “I would often be asked this question: ‘Are you running to win or running to run?’ I would say that you can be doing both. You can be serious and determined and ruthless in your dedication to winning the race. And then, also, you can develop it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The result has been historic. Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist backbench state assemblyman who before this year had almost no name recognition in New York City, is now the general-election favorite [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/nyregion/mayor-poll-nyc-quinnipiac.html] against a former governor and member of one of the most famous families in state politics. He has already shamed the incumbent mayor, who was running a distant fourth, into an early exit from the race.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the June primary, Mamdani didn’t just beat the odds; he blew the door off the hinges, reshaping the electorate and taking advantage of ranked-choice voting [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/07/26/nyregion/nyc-mayor-ranked-choice-map.html] to claim a commanding 12.8-point victory that reverberated through the country’s politics.\n",
        "\n",
        "But what happened after the primary may turn out to be even more important. In the time since then, as this article was being reported, Mamdani has engaged in a second primary of sorts, meeting quietly with city power brokers to consolidate support and box out his main rivals, Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams. Some of it was reported. Much of it wasn’t.\n",
        "\n",
        "For months now, Mamdani has been meeting privately with former leaders in city government, business executives, heads of New York arts and cultural institutions and skeptical local Democrats. The talks are pitched as get-to-know-you discussions with the new political star. But they also serve a dual purpose, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. In them, Mamdani has sought to present himself as a new type of leftist, a listener who understands his shortcomings and is willing to grow. He has acknowledged his lack of managerial experience and asked for advice. He has sought common ground. He has heard out his critics, including wealthy New Yorkers in business and finance and some pro-Israel activists who are turned off by his lifelong advocacy for Palestinians [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-israel-palestine.html] or offended by his reluctance to immediately condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” the use of which he later discouraged [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/business/mamdani-globalize-intafada-business-leaders.html].\n",
        "\n",
        "There have been two critical liaisons: Patrick Gaspard, a former Obama administration aide and director of the Democratic National Committee, and Sally Susman, a longtime corporate executive and member of the finance committees for the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Gaspard met Mamdani years ago. Susman met him this summer, one of several C-suiters who privately reached out to him after his much-talked-about July meeting with the Partnership for New York City [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/business/mamdani-nyc-business-leaders.html], a consortium of 350 members representing banks, law firms and corporations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Susman, who describes herself as a moderate pro-business Democrat, said she was impressed by how Mamdani handled himself amid the hostile crowd. Weeks later, she met with him for an hour, at her request, and said she left that interaction “taken by” his curiosity. She recalled that he asked questions like “What do you know about game-changing leadership?” and “How should I form an administration?” and made clear that there would be no “litmus tests” for staff roles in his cabinet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Susman has since become a valuable ally, convening two intimate gatherings at Mamdani’s campaign office — this time at his request — for business leaders and tech investors eager to meet him. “There’s something about him that makes people want to help him,” she told me.\n",
        "\n",
        "Robert Wolf, another Partnership for New York City member and a major fund-raiser for the Democratic Party, told me that he has begun texting with the candidate, becoming an informal pulse check for the city’s finance and business community. Wolf also met with Mamdani for an hour at his campaign office this month, an in-person follow-up to an hourlong Zoom meeting in August.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Zohran, to me, is more of a progressive capitalist,” Wolf told me, adding that he was convinced by their private interactions that Mamdani understood the importance of the private sector thriving in his New York. “He’s someone that wants to figure out how to use the government in an appropriate way on things that help equality and help the underserved.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The conversations have allowed Mamdani to reframe his previous positions, tweaking the us-versus-them language of his democratic-socialist values to be a tad less punitive. He has made it clear that he wants to support renters, not punish landlords. He wants to support public education, not take a hammer to specialized schools with elite admissions. He supports Palestinian rights; he’s not anti-Zionist. He made key concessions when it comes to policing. Importantly, he made clear that he was open to compromise when it came to his proposed millionaires’ tax. Call it Mamdani 2.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was an attempt to introduce a more mature left, focused on fulfilling its policy agenda rather than winning an ideological argument. Mamdani wants to be a good mayor — a great mayor. And he wants to be judged on the criteria that he has set for himself: no-cost universal child care, free buses for all and a four-year rent freeze for the city’s rent-stabilized apartments, the core planks of the affordability agenda that powered his primary campaign to victory. And he knows he can’t do it by himself — or with progressives alone. “Being right in and of itself is meaningless,” Mamdani told me when I asked about his approach to these meetings. “We have to win. And we have to deliver.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The subtle shifts, even the rhetorical ones, have helped fortify his lead, to the point where his victory is all but assured. This was not a foregone conclusion on primary night, when many of the city’s upper echelon — the same people who have warmed to Mamdani in recent months — had assumed that Cuomo or Adams would mount a bigger electoral challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "But Mamdani’s lead has withstood constant attacks by his opponents, hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on negative advertisements [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/26/nyregion/mamdani-opposition-attack-ads.html] and a full-on freak-out by the political establishment, including some Democrats who fear that he could be a useful wedge for Republicans, adversely affecting their swing-state candidates in next year’s midterm congressional elections. He has been called an antisemite for his pro-Palestinian advocacy and given the nickname “Mamdani the Commie” by President Trump, who has said he will withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani is elected and baselessly suggested that Mamdani, a naturalized citizen, was in the country illegally.\n",
        "\n",
        "At one point, I asked how much he followed the discussion regarding the takeaways from his primary win and its impact on the national Democratic Party. “I try not to spend too much time being engaged with the discourse of it all,” he said, though it is hard to believe him.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a “poster” we’re talking about, the millennial code word for someone who simply must share his thoughts on social media. The son of a celebrated filmmaker and an acclaimed academic [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-parents-mira-nair.html] who sought to start an indie rap career behind his mother’s Disney movie. Politics is his second act — an only-in-New York fairy tale that has captured the world’s attention, given his roots in India and Uganda and the immigrant-rich nature of the city’s electorate. And he has rewritten the rules for campaigning in the process, lapping opponents with an innovative digital strategy [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/29/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-campaign-videos.html] that has turned him into a bona fide internet celebrity in a signature suit and tie (he rotates three: one striped, one dotted, one red).\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani stands out further against a backdrop of Democratic Party failure. The party enters the second Trump era devoid of galvanizing leaders and meaningful policy ideas, largely rudderless and certainly visionless. In June, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that more than 60 percent of Democrats want fresh leadership [https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-want-new-leaders-focus-pocketbook-issues-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-06-19/], amid a wave of soul-searching and intraparty warfare that has been unleashed since the embarrassment of the 2024 election loss. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and Democratic Socialist who ran for president in 2016 and 2020, told me that Mamdani “is running a brilliant grass-roots campaign.” You would think, he continued, that Democrats “would be jumping up and down with joy, saying: ‘Thank god! This is the future of the Democratic Party!’ Unfortunately, there are others who look at it differently.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Over five months of following the campaign, including two interviews with the candidate and conversations with about 40 other people close to the race and its reverberations among national Democrats, I didn’t hear anyone express surprise that “Z” has almost pulled it off — such was the total belief in his charisma.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani excels at the game of interpersonal politics that Sanders so famously eschews. He loves a rope line as much as Joe Biden. Loves a selfie like Elizabeth Warren. And he stays until the end of a Black church service, noting that the rhythms of the Haitian drums are reminiscent of the Congolese music he grew up with. At New York’s West Indian American Day Parade this summer, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader — who has still withheld his endorsement of the nominee — made a pointed distinction between “jerk-chicken Brooklyn” and “Starbucks Brooklyn.” Mamdani moves easily through both.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet he increasingly feels the pressure of expectation, the natural consequence of the prospect of a weighty title: becoming the first Muslim mayor of New York City [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-muslim-mayor.html] and one of the few elected officials in the country who is not just liberal or progressive but unapologetically leftist. Mamdani told me he understands that his success or failure will not be seen as only his own. He is right.\n",
        "\n",
        "When I asked if there was a part of the city that had surprised him during the campaign, an experience or a neighborhood that inspired his connection to the city all over again, Mamdani took a beat to reflect. He can be prone to long pauses that can feel like a bit more of an awkward silence than a moment of building suspense.\n",
        "\n",
        "More than 20 seconds later, he had an answer: during Ramadan, in March.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani told me he tried to “attend as many new prayers and gatherings as possible.” Not just going to one celebration of Chand Raat, or “night of the moon,” the traditional South Asian festival, but as many as he could — “getting in that moment,” he said, “a snapshot of Muslim life across New York City.”\n",
        "\n",
        "His answer reminded me of just how different a candidate he is. Mamdani has placed his faith, his Indian-Ugandan roots and his pro-Palestinian activism at the center of the campaign, trusting the public to understand his vision and values even if the traditional gatekeepers did not. “I’ve met so many grandparents who’ve come up to me and said, ‘My grandkid told me if I don’t vote for you, then you can’t come home,’ ” he said, proud of the generational revolution he has inspired. “This redefinition of leadership,” he continued, “and the place of youth within our politics — it’s not just a question about me; it’s a question about New Yorkers themselves.”\n",
        "\n",
        "At that moment, I better understood the outsize reactions to Mamdani’s rise — among the people used to having power and money and among some in Democratic Party leadership. It’s not just what Mamdani believes in. Or that he was increasingly likely to occupy City Hall. It’s that he may have the temperament — and the public support — to sustain his political coalition past January’s inauguration and effect meaningful change to policy and legislation. Stardom is not what’s inherently threatening. Combining it with competence is.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be clear: Nobody asked Zohran Mamdani to run for mayor. Not the Democratic Socialists of America. Not the city’s progressive donor base. Not the Working Families Party, the institutional home of the city’s left wing. Mamdani hatched this plan himself early last year, at Qahwah House in Astoria, a Yemeni coffee shop that served as his local hide-out and unofficial scheming headquarters just blocks from his apartment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 2021 mayoral election, won by Eric Adams, had humbled New York’s left, as had the backlash to progressive causes like “defund the police” and the elimination of cash bail. But Mamdani saw an opportunity to form a coalition built from his own life and convictions: Muslims, South Asians, renters, young people and progressives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over cups of creamy spiced mofawar, Mamdani made the case to allies, interest-group leaders and, not least, the D.S.A. “One of the beautiful things about going through a D.S.A. endorsement process is that it’s a microcosm of the larger race,” Mamdani said, explaining that most “political processes are coronations or predetermined.” Not this one.\n",
        "\n",
        "The socialist group takes pride in its grueling endorsement process and bottom-up structure, meant to ensure that elected officials are committed to core values or face the wrath of rank-and-file members. D.S.A. leadership did not expect to support any candidate in the 2025 mayoral race, favoring an electoral strategy that focused on lower-level races.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I had to rely on my own conviction and the conviction of those who mattered around me, no matter what the response was,” he continued. “And having gone through all of that before entering the larger race meant that we were steeled.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani’s relationships with the D.S.A. and other allies go back a decade or more. He joined the D.S.A. after he was inspired by Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign, which led to a longstanding connection with New York City’s housing organizers and activists, informing his policy focus of making the city more affordable for its residents. He was already a member of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, where he connected with a growing network of Muslim and South Asian voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "But there was one issue that was most formative to Mamdani’s political identity, the one he knew he would never compromise on: Israel and Palestinians. Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian advocacy dates to his high school days at Bronx Science, when he furiously traded Facebook posts with a pro-Israel classmate, and continued at Bowdoin College, where he founded the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-israel-palestine.html].\n",
        "\n",
        "He told me these early experiences taught him the difference between seeing politics as an intellectual debate and a consequence of people’s lived experience. It also fueled his impatience with a worldview that he describes as “PEP” — or “progressive except Palestine” — a coinage that has been used on the left for years.\n",
        "\n",
        "“That exception is one that I believe we should not only take issue with because of what it means for Palestinians and Palestinian human rights,” he said. “But also, whenever you are at peace with the making of an exception, you make it easier to make another exception — wherever, whenever.”\n",
        "\n",
        "This defiant certitude was reflected in Mamdani’s campaign from the outset. He was convinced that the city’s diverse coalition of renters could unite behind an affordability agenda, even though polling encouraged a focus on public safety. He understood that many of the city’s immigrant communities were both underserved by the government and electoral resources that hadn’t been tapped. And over the last year, Americans’ views on Israel [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/polls/israel-gaza-war-us-poll.html] have drawn much closer to Mamdani’s than to Senator Chuck Schumer’s — perhaps the most establishment figure of all in New York — turning what was once assumed to be a political liability into a pillar of his truth-telling, anti-establishment credentials. In 2023, just days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Mamdani was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct [https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/10/15/two-queens-assemblymembers-charged-with-disorderly-conduct-after-protesting] as he protested outside Schumer’s home — telling reporters at the time that Israel’s retaliatory campaign could risk “imminent genocide.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“None of this works without him speaking up on Gaza,” said Gaspard, the former Obama administration aide, who likened it to Barack Obama’s opposition to the Iraq war before the 2008 presidential election. Gaspard has been a key figure connecting Mamdani with many of the city’s power players in the months since the primary, including Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.\n",
        "\n",
        "“For average people on the ground, having conversations in their barbecues or on their stoops, there’s a way that the issue of Gaza is a gateway to whether or not you can invite this political figure into your living room for a conversation about affordability or education or health care,” Gaspard said, citing new polling that shows growing disapproval of Israel’s actions among Democrats. “You don’t get to first base on the other things if you haven’t come out of the batter’s box on Gaza.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Gaspard first met Mamdani in South Africa in 2016, at the premiere for “Queen of Katwe,” a Disney movie set in Uganda and directed by Mamdani’s mother, Mira Nair. Gaspard said the young man, just 24 at the time, showed flashes of the charisma that would later serve his entrance into politics. He compared the curiosity and demeanor of young Mamdani to that of — yes — Barack Obama. But Mamdani’s is a story that, like that of many other first-generation immigrants, doesn’t fit neatly into American political conventions like the two-party system or our Black-white racial framework. A composite of multiple worlds: Indian, Ugandan, American, Muslim, New Yorker.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani told me that his Muslim faith, in particular, “has been a formative part of how I see the world — and how the world sees me,” particularly after the crackdown on mosques and the uptick in Islamophobia that came in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani said he remembers once telling his father, a professor of international affairs and anthropology at Columbia, that he was exhausted with “always feeling like a minority.” But his father’s reply changed his perspective. “I was an Indian in Uganda. I was a Muslim in India. And I was all of these things in New York City,” Mahmood Mamdani explained to his son. And “to be a minority is also to see the truth of the place amidst the promise of it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was this moment which took me from a view of the world where I had this chip on my shoulder,” Mamdani told me, “to one which made me understand instead both what the world took — and what it offered.”\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how Mamdani talks: in parables. He leans close and locks eyes. He collapses the room with held eye contact. He sprinkles in references to World Cup soccer and the English Premier League, as he knows I’m a fan of Tottenham Hotspur (Mamdani supports its rival club, Arsenal). He is one of the few politicians I can remember who sat for a 30-minute interview without a press person at hand and didn’t even bother recording themselves. Sanders was another.\n",
        "\n",
        "No wonder both thrive in the male-dominated, bro-heavy digital podcast space. Mamdani has appeared on Pablo Torre’s show [https://www.pablo.show/p/lina-khan-returns-feat-zohran-mamdani] (sports), “Throwing Fits [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMl6uocUQV0]” (fashion), Bloomberg’s “Odd Lots [https://www-bloomberg-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/news/audio/2025-07-11/odd-lots-what-nyc-s-ceos-think-about-zohran-mamdani-podcast]” (finance) — maybe the holy digital-media trinity for the millennial New York man. He has done “The View, [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mamdani-tells-view-withholding-federal-funds-nyc-trumps/story?id=126117784]” the “I’ve Had It [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM88cTxx0hw]” podcast and Hasan Piker’s popular Twitch stream [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ThzwqHprA], traversing the gamut of liberal-leftist media. On TikTok, he did a viral interview with Crackhead Barney — the New York performance artist and comedian who bombarded him with questions like “Would you claim African American status like Elon Musk?” The candidate answered each query earnestly, even the ridiculous ones, seemingly familiar with the bit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ritchie Torres, the Bronx Democrat and frequent critic of progressives, said Mamdani is “a once-in-a-generation communicator” who has mastered what he called the “three threes”: A candidate in today’s day and age needs to be able to explain ideas in a 30-second vertical social media video, a three-minute television hit and a three-hour long-form podcast.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering their ideological differences, which are particularly stark when it comes to Israel (Torres is a staunch defender), I asked why the congressman had been so complimentary of Mamdani publicly and privately.\n",
        "\n",
        "His answer spoke to the effectiveness of the Mamdani charm offensive and the eternal fact that all elected officials trade on the currency of attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Simple,” Torres said. “He reached out to me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Morris Katz, Mamdani’s senior adviser, told me that among the most important meetings of the campaign was its very first one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani was presented with polling that represented the conventional wisdom of the time — that public safety was the top concern among voters — and he instinctively dismissed it. This was going to be a campaign about affordability, he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“People have given up on the city government’s ability to deliver on affordability and lowering costs, and what we’re seeing is that lack of faith,” Katz remembers Mamdani saying at the time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani told me that his vision drew from his own experiences. The D.S.A. came after he volunteered for Ali Najmi, a civil rights lawyer and member of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York who was running for City Council. Najmi connected Mamdani with the group, and Mamdani later worked for Khader El-Yateem, a Palestinian American Lutheran pastor who was running for City Council in 2017.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both campaigns created a model for Mamdani that he would implement citywide eight years later. They focused on housing, particularly the crisis for renters that had been accelerated by gentrification. Perhaps most significant was that El-Yateem did not seek to moderate his position on Israel and the Palestinians, saying he “100 percent” supported the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and campaigning with Linda Sarsour, the D.S.A. member and Palestinian American activist who has been accused of antisemitism.\n",
        "\n",
        "But the thing about the campaigns that Mamdani worked on is that they all lost. What the comparison reveals is that his current electoral success springs not only from his values but also from his unique traits as a candidate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani calls himself a Democrat, something many on the left (Sanders included) do not. In his hands, the cry of “gentrification” has become a focus on affordability, a more welcoming umbrella that tracks with his growing willingness to acknowledge a private-sector role in building more housing units. There is no Linda Sarsour on his campaign trail.\n",
        "\n",
        "This willingness to temper his previous positions and allegiances, which Mamdani has proved since the primary, is what sets him apart from some leftist contemporaries, said Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president and the Democratic nominee for city comptroller. Levine contrasted Mamdani’s modus operandi with the governing style of Democratic mayors past, including Bill de Blasio, a progressive who racked up enemies through petty slights and misjudged moments, even as he shared many of Mamdani’s populist goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "After Mamdani won the Democratic primary, his campaign compiled a list of the city’s top business leaders and called each of them one by one, underscoring his desire to build coalitions and establish an open line of communication. “I want to emphasize how unprecedented this is — the first nominee in memory that has made a concerted effort to reach out to people who were against him in the primary,” Levine told me.\n",
        "\n",
        "Among New York’s progressives, no one has forgotten the cautionary tale of how de Blasio effectively lost the New York Police Department in his first term. The fraught relationship plummeted to a nadir after the killing of two officers in late 2014, when the police turned their backs on the mayor at the hospital and then at the funerals.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the George Floyd protests of June 2020, Mamdani posted on Twitter: “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”\n",
        "\n",
        "But since the primary, Mamdani has repeatedly distanced himself from those statements, saying he would apologize to the Police Department [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/nyregion/mamdani-police-apology-floyd.html] if elected. He has gone even further in private, recently meeting with more than two dozen rank-and-file police officers in a closed-door session focused on officer retention and public safety. There, Mamdani explicitly apologized for the June 2020 tweet, a spokeswoman said. He has also spoken approvingly of Jessica Tisch, the current police commissioner, who is well liked by city institutions and the rank and file. In our interview, Mamdani stressed that his praise for Tisch was “sincere” and that he was considering keeping her on as commissioner.\n",
        "\n",
        "I asked Mamdani how sincere could he be, considering that Tisch has been clear that she is opposed to criminal-justice reforms supported by most progressives.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There is — and has to be — room for disagreement among those at the core of your City Hall,” Mamdani said in response. He said one of his staffing goals as mayor would be to ensure that the people around him “are not characterized by the quickness with which they can say yes to any one of your ideas.” This is also a theme that Mamdani has stressed in private, telling Susman he believed in a “team of rivals.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the summer, Mamdani faced his first crisis related to public safety — when he was in Uganda, celebrating his wedding to Rama Duwaji, a 27-year-old illustrator, with family and friends.\n",
        "\n",
        "On July 28, a gunman strode into a Park Avenue office tower and opened fire [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/28/nyregion/nyc-shooting], killing four people, including two security guards, one of whom was an off-duty police officer. Soon after the news became public, Cuomo and Adams began to point the finger at Mamdani — because he was out of the country, but also to highlight his previous stances on public safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "What happened next surprised everyone. That off-duty officer, Didarul Islam, was a Bangladeshi American Muslim and had actually been at the same mosque as Mamdani during the candidate’s tour of Eid services. And once Mamdani rushed back to the United States, after he was awakened by Katz’s 4 a.m. call, he went directly from Kennedy Airport to the family’s home in the Bronx, where he visited with the mourners for an hour. Later that day, he delivered a stirring rebuke to Cuomo and Adams, whom he accused of trying to score “cynical political points” rather than supporting the family. Standing with the co-founder of the Bangladeshi American Police Association [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-kBw0OT7N0], Mamdani made clear that he would not be intimidated by the soft-on-crime attacks that have doomed so many other progressives. If the tragic event was a grim sort of mayoral pop quiz, the candidate seemed to pass it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Which is why his repeated promise to order the Police Department to arrest the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, if he were to come to New York City while Mamdani was mayor, has confounded several of Mamdani’s allies — and fed his enemies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani has said he would be honoring the warrant issued by the International Criminal Court charging Netanyahu with crimes against humanity in Gaza. But the United States does not recognize the authority of the I.C.C., and legal experts regard such an arrest as most likely illegal. More to the point, the act could prompt something like a constitutional crisis with the Police Department. Trump has already promised that he would intercede.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arresting Netanyahu is also not a primary goal of Mamdani’s leftist base. When I asked Gustavo Gordillo, who leads the New York City chapter of the D.S.A., about what he sees as Mamdani’s nonnegotiable campaign promises, he named the affordability agenda. I asked Murad Awawdeh, who leads the New York Immigrant Coalition and knows Mamdani from the Muslim Democratic Club, if arresting Netanyahu was important to him as a Palestinian. He said no.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of Mamdani’s Jewish supporters warn that an arrest attempt would permanently fracture the bonds he has painstakingly sought to form. Brad Lander, the city comptroller and former mayoral candidate, who was a key validator and an ally in liberal Jewish communities, shrugged off the candidate’s promise to arrest Netanyahu, refusing to comment on the record. What’s important, Lander said, is a different promise Mamdani made on the night of the primary, when he said: “‘I am going to reach out and listen and try to understand.’ And he has more than lived up to that commitment.” Lander recalled sitting with Mamdani as a group of Orthodox Jews described being called antisemitic slurs on the street. “He was just a very human, empathetic listener,” he said, “and in that case just communicated clearly that he thought that was awful.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Representative Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic stalwart who endorsed Mamdani in June and is considered a more mainstream Jewish voice than Lander, said he believes that the pledge to arrest Netanyahu is “simply unrealistic.” He continued: “The City of New York has no jurisdiction to do such a thing,” though, he added, “I appreciate the sensibility behind” the candidate’s statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Still, Mamdani is resolute, even though it’s a campaign promise that is likely to be tested. Netanyahu, like Trump, is prone to provocation and could very well arrive in New York next year simply to call the new mayor’s bluff.\n",
        "\n",
        "On our walk back from the luncheonette, Mamdani stood by his promise — again. “It is important that New York City is in compliance with international criminal law,” he said firmly.\n",
        "\n",
        "I asked how this stance fit alongside the other things he had said to me: that his only goal was to deliver on buses and rent, that he knew his administration would be judged at a higher standard, that it bothered him when politicians did not focus on policies that effect material change.\n",
        "\n",
        "But by now we were approaching his campaign office, stuck in a crammed Manhattan service elevator with a very large security guard. With my time running out, the candidate made his response quick, signaling that this interview was now over.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is this a campaign promise that’s compatible with governing?” I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We’re going to show how it is,” he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "For better or worse, a remarkable number of the Democratic Party’s most influential figures currently live in New York. Schumer and Jeffries, both of Brooklyn, lead their respective caucuses in Congress. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of the Bronx, is the party’s most famous progressive and a possible presidential candidate in 2028. Mamdani has already positioned himself among this echelon, pushing his way into a struggle that is not just ideological but generational.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most New York Democrats have now endorsed Mamdani, including the Albany elected officials most critical to his agenda, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Speaker Carl Heastie, as well as Nadler, who is retiring from the House, and Yvette Clarke, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even some of the most towering national Democrats, including Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris, have made congratulatory calls to Mamdani — and they wanted everyone to know it, making clear they recognized the enthusiasm he inspired even if they disagreed with some of his stances and policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The establishment’s embrace has only made the actions — or rather inaction — of Jeffries, Schumer and other Mamdani holdouts, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, stand out even more. Jeffries and Schumer have been vague, refraining from endorsing Mamdani after the primary but also not exactly refusing to. Representative Tom Suozzi, a swing-district Democrat who represents parts of eastern Queens and Long Island, has made clear that Mamdani will never receive his endorsement, saying that “Democratic Socialists should create their own party, because I don’t want that in my party.”\n",
        "\n",
        "This tension was on full display at a fascinating moment I witnessed in August at the West Indian American Day Parade breakfast in Brooklyn, an annual fund-raising event that is a go-to stop on the summer schedule for all New York Democrats. There, I approached Jeffries and asked for an interview about Mamdani and the broader mayor’s race. He agreed and pointed me toward his political staff, who later affirmed that he would be interested in talking.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the breakfast, Jeffries was in the middle of speaking, hammering on the economic chaos sown by Trump’s tariffs and the Medicaid cuts in the recent spending package passed by the Republican-led Congress — standard Democratic fare. But when Mamdani arrived, the immediate jolt of excitement was such that even Jeffries could not ignore it. Cameras flashed, people rushed for selfies and some of the reporters huddled around Jeffries fled for Mamdani instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a visual representation of how quickly Jeffries, the Brooklyn congressman handpicked by Nancy Pelosi to succeed her as House speaker and lead Democrats into the future, already seems as if he has missed his moment.\n",
        "\n",
        "A month later, Jeffries still didn’t seem to have a clear idea about how to handle Mamdani. “I just haven’t weighed in one way or the other,” Jeffries said about the mayor’s race during an appearance on Don Lemon’s YouTube show in September. Schumer has said less, signaling through advisers that while he likes Mamdani personally, he is worried about the effect an endorsement could have on Senate candidates in the midterms (there’s also that 2023 arrest while protesting outside Schumer’s home). Gillibrand had to call Mamdani and apologize after she falsely claimed he had made “references to global jihad.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I never did get to talk with Jeffries about Mamdani. Several phone calls to his team soon turned to voice mail messages that went unanswered. In October I told Jeffries’s staff that I would have to write that he avoided talking about Mamdani for months. There was still no response. Schumer and Gillibrand each declined an interview request.\n",
        "\n",
        "Endorsements rarely have a tangible impact in an election. But they are a leading indicator of a candidate’s standing within his party, and the fact that so many national Democratic figures have refrained from embracing Mamdani speaks to a moment of real reckoning for the party. Mamdani has galvanized the exact voters who turned away from Democrats in 2024: working-class people of color, young people and first-generation Americans. But whether his playbook is adopted more broadly is one of political will. “Millionaire taxes poll extremely well,” Heastie said while endorsing Mamdani this year. Criticizing Israel polls just as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Which is why what’s most interesting about the Jeffries-Mamdani relationship (or the lack of one) is what’s beneath it. Mamdani won Jeffries’s congressional district by around 12 points, about the same margin as his overall victory. And he did so without the blessing of traditional Democratic gatekeepers, bringing new voters to the process of expanding the electorate: the exact same political strategy Sanders sought to accomplish in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to a recent data analysis of the primary by Gothamist [https://gothamist.com/news/how-newly-registered-nyc-voters-are-helping-fuel-zohran-mamdanis-campaign], 7 percent of New York City primary voters were first-time registrants in 2025, up five points from the Democratic election four years earlier, amounting to 76,860 first-time voters out of 1,071,730 total, with a majority in the age group of 18 to 34 and in districts won by Mamdani. What all this means is that the city has changed, and its Democratic politics are changing with it, in ways that could portend shifting alliances across the country.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both Jeffries and Schumer are also facing the prospect of left-wing primary challengers in the coming election cycles. Ocasio-Cortez could run for president in 2028 or mount a primary challenge to Schumer, with Mamdani as a likely ally in either run. Jeffries has a more immediate concern, considering that he’s up for re-election next year and Brooklyn’s Mamdani fever is especially hot in his district. Chi Ossé, a City Council member from Brooklyn and early Mamdani endorser, is one possible challenger. Another is Jabari Brisport, a state senator who is a member of the D.S.A. and a close friend of Mamdani’s.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the city’s old guard, Jeffries’s antipathy for the D.S.A. is not without merit. For years, the organization represented the worst of the so-called Bernie Bro — overwhelmingly white, male and in possession of a degree from an elite school that they would be happy to tell you about. They posted about politics and rarely participated in the actual messy work of it. Even some of the group’s own members, like State Senator Julia Salazar, the first D.S.A. member elevated to Albany in 2018, said that the organization has grown from its past and that Mamdani has shown how, with the right candidate, the organizational model can be deployed beyond its original base.\n",
        "\n",
        "But that expansion is not without growing pains — and electoral risk. During this mayoral campaign, Mamdani has faced criticism from the left, for maybe the first time in his electoral career. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators have disrupted his events, critical of his position that Israel has a right to exist. And he is increasingly cast as a sellout by some on leftist social media.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gordillo, the co-chairman of the city chapter, told me that he expects a Mamdani mayoralty to showcase the organization’s maturation, just as the primary did. So I ran through a list of hypotheticals of Mamdani in office: What if he keeps Jessica Tisch as police commissioner? What if he doesn’t back D.S.A. primary challengers against Democratic incumbents?\n",
        "\n",
        "When I first spoke to Gordillo, he said he could see a world in which none of those Mamdani reversals would be a clear red line with the D.S.A. left. But weeks later, as the prospect of Tisch staying on seemed to grow more real, Gordillo said that would be more of a problem — reflecting the potential tension between Mamdani the mayor and the uncompromising base that helped get him elected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another thing Gordillo made clear: He did not want Mamdani to abandon his call for a millionaires’ tax.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Supporting a millionaires’ tax and supporting taxing the rich is something we all want and expect,” Gordillo said. “To back off on taxing the rich would be to change the kind of project we’re pursuing.” I pointed out that Mamdani has already shown signs of being flexible on the tax, telling me that “it’s more important what we fund than how.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“If there was magically federal funding for all the things that he wanted, that would be a conversation,” Gordillo responded. “That’s just so out of the realm of what anyone expects.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike Gordillo, Mamdani calls himself a Democrat. But that doesn’t mean he agrees with Jeffries’s position that Democratic primary challengers are distractions to the job at hand: a united opposition to Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I see the next several years as an opportunity to fulfill the agenda,” Mamdani said when I asked if he would consider endorsing a primary challenger to a Democratic incumbent. “And I think the possibility of delivering on these political commitments in a material way is something that cannot only transform our political reality but also people’s relationship to politics.” It wasn’t really an answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "I tried again. “Is the moment ever coming where you’ll put the D.S.A. at arm’s length and say, ‘I’m a Democrat now’?”\n",
        "\n",
        "At that moment, our server arrived, giving Mamdani an opportunity to take another one of his signature pauses. He then asked me to clarify the question, and I asked whether he would ever back a Democratic incumbent over a D.S.A. challenger.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The conditions within which I accept and make endorsements are on the basis of the agenda that I’m running on,” he said deliberately, and then brought the point home. “I have an openness to working with anyone to achieve that agenda.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani’s embrace of mass politics could reinvigorate the Democrats’ left wing. Since Biden’s 2020 victory, that side of the party had gone quiet, such was the establishment capture among Democrats over the last several years. Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, once critical voices, were key validators for the Biden White House on domestic economic policy and climate change. Ocasio-Cortez — far and away the Democrats’ most important millennial voice — defended Biden’s re-election bid after his disastrous debate performance. Ocasio-Cortez also did not respond to several requests for comment. (Like Jeffries, her staff indicated several times that she would be open to speaking — and several messages then went unanswered.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Adriano Espaillat, the Dominican American congressman who originally backed Cuomo before endorsing Mamdani, told me that the generational and political divide Mamdani has highlighted in Black and Jewish communities also applies to Latinos. He said that Cuomo was a “familiar name” in his district but that Mamdani has something more valuable — fresh ideas.\n",
        "\n",
        "The disruption has also caused some concern. Some Democrats fear that the rising tide of immigration, including South Asians, Latinos and first-generation Americans, could displace their own political power within the party. And scores of local elected officials refused to talk about Mamdani and the impact of the changing alliances, including Representative Gregory Meeks, a Queens Democrat and head of the Congressional Black Caucus’s political-action committee, who has also declined to endorse Mamdani; and Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate in the primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "With their silence, they reveal the left’s ultimate advantage in this period of upheaval. Political triangulation runs dangerously close to inauthenticity, but it has been the model for most mainstream Democratic candidates since Obama made the Clintonian posture his own in 2008. But separated from its unique candidate, and the myth that Trump was an aberration, Obama-ism has been exposed, leaving the Democratic establishment in a frantic search for a Plan B.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s a place that is all too reminiscent of where Republicans were about a decade earlier, after Obama’s re-election revealed a chasm between the interests of party leaders and its working-class base. The 2016 election was approaching. We all know what happened next.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani and I are both fans of European soccer, the kind who will set an alarm at 7 a.m. to watch a team halfway across the world inevitably disappoint us week after week. It’s why I was vaguely aware of him outside of politics before the mayoral run — I knew he liked Arsenal (and he tweeted about it). But it’s also why I knew that this September afternoon in Brooklyn meant so much to him, as he sat in a Fort Greene bar called FancyFree watching Arsenal with Spike Lee, maybe the only famous New Yorker who loves the team as much as he does.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over 30 minutes of game time, the two made fast friends as they writhed in agony, banged the wall in frustration and helped lead the bar in Arsenal chants. (Lee was seemingly peeved that I had been invited by Mamdani’s team to join them and made clear to me that he was there only to watch soccer, not to talk politics to a reporter). When the half ended, patrons serenaded Mamdani on his way out, chanting the candidate’s name to the tune of “Seven Nation Army” — the universal soccer sign of approval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani has made this kind of celebrity encounter a feature of his campaign. He has appeared at concerts by Wu-Tang Clan at Madison Square Garden and Lucy Dacus. Emily Ratajkowski, the model, actress and social media celebrity, posted an Instagram video on the day of the primary of herself standing with Mamdani and wearing a “Hot Girls For Zohran” T-shirt [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLSHcLUsPnX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==]. The video got more than 300,000 likes.\n",
        "\n",
        "This blend of culture and politics was always part of the plan drawn up over coffee at Qahwah House, when Mamdani stressed that any successful candidacy would require a social media movement. He was Mira Nair’s son after all, raised with an understanding of how storytelling can shape political reality. During his time in the State Assembly, he studied people like Ocasio-Cortez and Ossé, the City Council member who is popular on TikTok, reaching out to learn about their social media strategy in an effort to create his own. It required a pivot, a step away from the condensation of X to platforms like YouTube and Instagram reels, where the tone and format were a better match for political organizing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani’s digital operation, led by the creative director Andrew Epstein, has been a prized part of the campaign from its early stages, when the return on investment was immediately clear: In one of the first videos [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyL4PsmA3u8], Mamdani explained the rising food costs for halal trucks in New York City (“halalflation”), and it racked up more than 360,000 views on YouTube alone, driving home the organic audience the message was finding online.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mamdani says his political imagination is born out of necessity. To deliver on his promised agenda and maintain the first-of-its-kind coalition that has brought him to the doorstep of power, Mamdani will test the limits of his political capital, even with the help of more than four million Instagram followers and an extensive volunteer operation. “Politics is not something that they must simply have,” Mamdani said. “It’s something that they must do.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have brought so many to politics for the first time in a long time, and there’s a responsibility that you don’t waste that hope,” he continued. “You don’t get a second chance in convincing someone that they have a place in the politics of our city and our country.”\n",
        "\n",
        "After Lee and Mamdani posed for photos, I joined the candidate on his drive uptown, as he hurried to make it to the African American Day Parade in Harlem, the annual event along Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. The last time I interviewed him, earlier in September, we parted hours before the news broke that the conservative activist Charlie Kirk had been shot and killed in Utah, reigniting discussions about America’s deep polarization and the violence it begets.\n",
        "\n",
        "This time, Kirk’s death was where I wanted to start, considering that Mamdani lives a similarly public life. Mamdani said that the killing was “horrific” and that he learned about it on social media, where he, like many others, was served a graphic video of the disturbing moment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The shooting, he told me, was “illustrative of the fabric of this country coming apart at the seams and this being a moment where we are really staring into the abyss.” Mamdani added that he worries more for “the people around me” than himself — and that his team had made some changes to his security protocols in response to the shooting.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Really?” I asked. “You don’t see that and worry about yourself?”\n",
        "\n",
        "I wondered because the prospect of violence was something Mamdani’s allies had worried openly about to me, invoking the concerns that many Black voters had about Obama’s historic run in 2008.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I try not to,” he said. But just the previous week, a Texas man was charged with making death threats against Mamdani and his family, saying he wanted to “see an I.D.F. bullet go through” Mamdani’s skull.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think for a long time, it’s felt as if the safest place, especially as a Muslim in public life, was to be in the shadows,” Mamdani said. “And yet we see that that safety is all too tenuous. And to allow ourselves to be intimidated is to, in some ways, allow for the continuation of that very kind of politics.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The conversation turned to the aftermath of Kirk’s killing, specifically ABC’s decision to take the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air in response to complaints by Trump and conservative activists. Mamdani denounced the decision, and the next day he would pull out of a scheduled town hall with a local ABC affiliate, helping to kick off a wave of boycotts that helped get Kimmel reinstated.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The story of Trump’s authoritarianism cannot be told without the cowardice of so many institutions across this country,” Mamdani told me. He then offered some advice for those institutional leaders, for the Democratic Party, for the public.\n",
        "\n",
        "“If you want to defeat this attack on our city and our values and our people,” he said, “the most effective way to do so is to fight back. It’s not to acquiesce.”\n",

        "\n",
        "Instead of dignity, justice and equality, the majority experience despair, insecurity and hunger.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beneath this lies another truth: the widening social gap between leaders and the working class. If left unchallenged, this gap will blunt our movements, empower conservative forces and open the door to fascism and dictatorship.\n",

        "From Chiawelo to the suburbs – the changing lives of leaders\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 1980s, Cyril Ramaphosa lived in the townships, in Chiawelo, Soweto, like every shop steward and union leader of that generation. Leaders then shared the daily reality of the poor: police raids, overcrowded classrooms, raw sewage, electricity cut-offs, gang violence. Their authority came from authenticity.\n",
        "\n",
        "1994 changed that. Apartheid barriers fell and black professionals entered spaces once reserved for whites — boardrooms, government offices, executive posts. This was genuine progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "But militants who once fought oppression from the townships were absorbed into corporate boardrooms, state institutions and managerial roles. For the most part, leaders with well-paying jobs in the state, as well as in unions and NGOs, moved out of the townships that were gradually desegregating. The organic link between leadership and working-class life weakened.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 1970s, up to the dawn of democracy, union membership was largely restricted to blue-collar ranks and leadership was an exclusive preserve of the rank-and-file proletariat.\n",
        "\n",
        "With democracy and the expansion of organising into the public sector, members in junior managerial positions joined and over time, even more senior personnel became members and leaders.\n",
        "\n",
        "While this was in many respects a positive development, it also imported conservatism into union leadership. The least-paid workers, without bonds or car loans, have little to lose in a protracted strike. The opposite is true for those in more senior positions, often locked into home loans and car repayments, whose material conditions make them more risk-averse and less militant.\n",
        "\n",
        "A distorted transformation\n",
        "\n",
        "We do not condemn the emergence of a black middle class or the promotion of black professionals. These were long overdue. What we condemn is the distorted transformation that accompanied it:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Unemployment on the expanded definition stands at 42.9% (Q2 2025, StatsSA). Among black Africans, it is even higher, at 47.5%, compared with just 10.3% for whites;\n",
        "\n",
        "* Black women face the harshest reality, with an expanded unemployment rate of 52% — more than half without work;\n",
        "\n",
        "* Youth unemployment is catastrophic: under the expanded definition, more than six in 10 black young people cannot find jobs;\n",
        "\n",
        "* Inequality entrenched: South Africa remains the most unequal society in the world, with a Gini coefficient above 0.67 (World Bank);\n",
        "\n",
        "* Poverty and hunger: more than 20 million people experience food insecurity daily, with 2.1 million households reporting hunger (StatsSA); and\n",
        "\n",
        "* Public services collapsing: police stations without vehicles, clinics without medicines, overcrowded schools, dysfunctional Home Affairs and prisons unfit for dignity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the statistics, the human cost is harrowing. Children have been reported dying of hunger in public hospitals. Mothers skip meals so their children can eat. Families boil weeds to stave off hunger. This is the daily reality for millions and it exposes the brutality of a system that allows supermarkets to post record profits while people starve.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is transformation without liberation — a process that uplifts a minority while leaving millions, especially black women and youth, excluded. It is a transition of elites, not a transformation of society.\n",
        "\n",
        "The media blackout and editor disconnect\n",
        "\n",
        "The same social gap shapes the media. Many black editors once endured detention without trial and township repression. Today, they live in leafy suburbs and preside over newsrooms that black out working-class struggles:\n",
        "\n",
        "* South Africa sees five major protests a day — more than 13,000 a year — led overwhelmingly by poor women and youth fighting for water, housing and services. Yet these protests are rarely reported unless they disrupt traffic, in which case they are reduced to traffic news;\n",

        "\n",
        "* Workers’ marches against Shoprite and food monopolies, protesting against profiteering while millions go hungry, are dismissed as irrelevant. Meanwhile, Shoprite’s profits — R7.5-billion in 2025, over R20-million a day — are celebrated as a success. Its CEO’s R83-million salary is normalised; and\n",
        "\n",
        "* Even solidarity demonstrations for Palestine are distorted. Protest against genocide is routinely framed as requiring a “balancing voice” — giving Zionist apologists for ethnic cleansing a right of reply, as if those defending genocide deserve equal moral standing with those resisting it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The result is a warped public consciousness: the struggles of the poor are erased, while the battles of the elites dominate headlines. Hunger, evictions and genocide are invisible; corruption scandals and corporate profits are treated as the nation’s true story.\n",
        "\n",
        "This erasure is compounded by the media’s pro-Western bias. Democracy and freedom are often conflated with Western approval and South Africa is implicitly pressured to behave as a vassal state of the West — as Kenya and others have been reduced to. The assumption that the West alone defines democracy is one of the most dangerous distortions of our time.\n",

        "Conservatism rising, with warning bells\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "But the warning signs are there. Material conditions shape consciousness. As leaders move further from the township, anger risks dissipating. As black professionals adapt to the suburbs and former Model C schools — still dominated by whites, still excluding African languages — neoliberal ideas harden. Capitalism becomes “common sense.” Efficiency trumps justice. Hunger is normalised.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is not universal, but it is a trend we must ring alarm bells about.\n",
        "\n",
        "Spatial development, gentrification and monopoly power\n",
        "\n",
        "The most dangerous expression of this conservatism is in spatial development.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Cape Town, black professionals cannot afford to live in the city centre. Luxury apartments rise while the poor are forced further to the periphery. Apartheid’s geography is reborn through the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Johannesburg, disillusioned workers may be swayed to back Helen Zille. But a “clean city” under her leadership will mean:\n",

        "* Evicting the poor from “hijacked buildings” without providing alternative housing;\n",
        "\n",

        "The middle class, working-class frustration and the Zille danger\n",
        "\n",
        "In Johannesburg, the collapse of governance has created fertile ground for reaction. A hapless ANC mayor presides over a metro defined by potholes, blackouts (sometimes affecting even middle-class areas due to “load reduction” disconnections for everyone regardless of whether they have paid their bill), petty crime, failing water and sanitation and endless corruption scandals.\n",

        "Rents all over the country are too darn high – and thanks to the New York City mayoral campaign, discussions about how to control them are back in the national spotlight.\n",
        "\n",
        "Housing is at the heart of the campaign of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee – and \"freeze the rent\" is one of its key planks.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "As Mamdani explains it, millions of New Yorkers live in \"rent-stabilized\" homes, where annual increases are determined by a government board. Mamdani says he wants to halt annual increases for four years after a period in which current Mayor Eric Adams allowed rent to rise as much as 9% a year.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, while rent stabilization may feel like a holy grail for tenants lucky enough to snag such a deal, experts say, limiting how much landlords can charge is a blunt tool that won't solve the affordability crisis – and might even make it worse. The best way to make rent more manageable, most housing observers believe, is to take a broad-based approach to overall housing affordability, including by increasing supply and easing local restrictions – which Mamdani also has proposed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Rent control lowers costs for some residents, but it raises costs for more residents, so overall that is net negative for affordability,\" said Alex Horowitz, project director for housing policy at The Pew Charitable Trusts. \"The most important driver of housing affordability is whether there are enough homes. When there aren't enough homes, that creates competition for homes that are scarce. So prices get bid up and rents get bid up, which creates a long-term seller's market and a long-term landlord's market.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Such arguments aren't just economics textbook ideas, say Horowitz and other observers. There are multiple real-world examples of American cities experimenting with increasing supply, and having rents fall as a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Salim Furth, an economist who directs the Urbanity project at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, offers Denver and Austin as recent examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Denver, a surge of new construction led to a 6.4% vacancy rate as of this summer and declining rents, according to a landlord advocacy group. It's the same story in Austin, where rents are still above where they were pre-pandemic, but down from the 2023 peak.\n",
        "\n",
        "By contrast, New York City had a vacancy rate of 1.4% as of 2024, the most recent data available.\n",
        "\n",
        "Past efforts to control rental increases have led to unintended yet serious consequences, observers say.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gonzalo Respighi Grasso, a doctoral candidate in economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has made rent control the focus of his research. He cites a 2019 paper by researchers Rebecca Diamond, Tim McQuade and Franklin Qian that looked at the effects of implementing rent control in San Francisco in 1994.\n",
        "\n",
        "Landlords responded to that policy by converting for-rent apartments to owner-occupied condos or by encouraging redevelopment that would allow new construction to be exempt from rent control. Meanwhile, tenants who lived in homes that became rent-controlled had far less incentive to leave, which wound up limiting their mobility, according to the 2019 paper and other research, Respighi Grasso said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Since many of the existing rental properties were converted to higher-end, owner-occupied condominium housing and new construction rentals, the passage of rent control ultimately led to a housing stock which caters to higher income individuals,\" the 2019 paper concluded.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It appears rent control has actually contributed to the gentrification of San Francisco, the exact opposite of the policy's intended goal. Indeed, by simultaneously bringing in higher income residents and preventing displacement of minorities, rent control has contributed to widening income inequality of the city.\" While rent control may not be the panacea some hope for, observers agree that some measure of government assistance is needed, given the scope of the housing crisis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Across the nation, a whopping half of all renters were \"cost-burdened\" as of 2023, the most recent data available, meaning they spent more than 30% of their income on housing and utilities. That includes the 27% who spend more than half their income on those expenses. In New York, that's 856,800 households, according to an analysis of city data performed by the Citizens Budget Commission for USA TODAY.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Some people aren't going to have enough money to afford decent housing, even in a market that has a lot of homes,\" Pew's Horowitz said in an interview. Subsidies such as housing choice vouchers may be solid policy choices for lower-income residents, he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "And Marie Claire Tran-Leung, who leads the Evictions Initiative Project at the National Housing Law Project, stressed the importance of protections for tenants as prices spike higher in many jurisdictions and the federal government pulls back on housing efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Rent stabilization works in concert with other tenant protections,\" Tran-Leung told USA TODAY. \"In this environment, protection against landlord retaliation is especially important because the rents that tenants may have in a given place are only as good as they are enforced.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The housing law project and others are engaged in efforts to help tenants access legal representation in the court system, she said: \"We often work with tenants who may have a viable claim against the landlord but the landlord can easily make a case for nonpayment.\"\n",

        "Sources told Axios [https://www.axios.com/2025/10/09/zohran-mamdani-ally-challenge-hakeem-jeffries] that Ossé, a 27-year-old former Black Lives Matter [https://www.tampafp.com/?s=Black+Lives+Matter] activist with a massive social media following, had spoken with progressive groups about taking on Jeffries, one of the nation’s most powerful Democrats, in next year’s primary. The discussions gained traction after democratic socialist Mamdani won the mayoral primary in Jeffries’ home turf of Brooklyn.\n",
        "\n",
        "The progressive frustration is centered on Jeffries’ reluctance to endorse Mamdani over former Governor Andrew Cuomo [https://www.tampafp.com/?s=Andrew+Cuomo], who is running as an independent.

According to Axios, the Minority Leader’s team has issued a “smashmouth warning,” threatening to target democratic socialists in the state legislature should they go after his congressional seat. An adviser to Jeffries also derisively dubbed those considering a run against him as “Team Gentrification.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Ossé, who backed Mamdani [https://www.tampafp.com/?s=Mamdani] in the mayoral primary, is seen by progressives as having the kind of anti-establishment, direct-communication style to potentially take on the minority leader. Mamdani previously cited Ossé and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [https://www.tampafp.com/?s=Rep.+Alexandria+Ocasio-Cortez] (D-N.Y.) as showing him “the power of communication without an intermediary.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the progressives’ interest, some Democrats remained skeptical that Ossé would proceed with a run, partly due to his expressed wariness of Washington, D.C., and the formidable political machine Jeffries commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a text message to Axios late Wednesday, Ossé first said, “it would take a very dire situation in order for me to even consider spending the rest of my 20s in dc,” before sending a follow-up message 20 minutes later: “Just to be clear, I’m not running for Congress.”\n",

        "America is in the midst of a housing crisis. Homelessness hit a record high last year, rising 18 percent in 2024. Meanwhile, rent spiked by 50 percent in the past decade, rendering the typical American consumer ‘rent burdened’ for the first time in decades. Americans are also struggling to purchase homes, as all across the country the median-priced home is out of reach for the average income earner. The lack of affordable housing disproportionately harms marginalized groups — especially Black Americans who are twice as likely to rent, and more likely to suffer homelessness or eviction.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "As a response, a growing number of cities and states are turning to rent control. In 2019, Oregon became the first in the nation to pass statewide rent control, and earlier this year, Washington State passed a bill capping rent increases at ten percent annually. The likely next mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, has promised to freeze rent, expanding upon The Big Apple’s already stringent rent stabilization laws. Rent control even made it to the national stage in 2024 through the platform of Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Although rent control is gaining political traction, it is a deeply flawed policy. Rent control reduces new development, erodes housing quality, and raises rent in the long run, all while contributing to gentrification and inequality. Rent control would only worsen the housing crisis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rent control artificially sets the price of rent below market value, discouraging developers from investing in new buildings; incentivizing landlords to take their units off the rental market. After St. Paul, Minnesota capped rent increases to three percent annually, new building permits decreased by 80 percent within three months of the policy being passed. And in San Francisco, rent control sparked a wave of rental units being converted to condos, causing renters in rent-controlled units to drop 25 percent. Choking supply leads to large rent increases in the long run as units become more scarce, especially in low-income areas where condominiums are unaffordable and development is sparse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rent control is successful at keeping tenants in their homes, but this comes at a cost: tenants are less likely to move out of units that don’t fit their needs. In order to continue paying lower rent, tenants will also remain in deteriorating housing, caused by rent control disincentivizing landlords from adequately maintaining units.\n",
        "\n",
        "New renters are especially harmed by rent control, as when tenants stay put as it becomes almost impossible for new renters to find housing. Low housing mobility causes prices in the uncontrolled sector to balloon, as renters compete for the shrinking share of market-rate housing through bidding up the price. But even in the controlled sector, price ceilings are not always successful in keeping rent stable. For instance, a study of New York City’s housing stock found that the controlled sector actually paid more per month in rent than the uncontrolled sector. Rent control simply changed the timing of payment as opposed to causing a permanent decline in cost, as tenants merely exchanged higher rent in the long run for lower rent in the short run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Proponents of rent control argue that it fights inequality, but in reality, rent control facilitates discrimination and leads to gentrification. If potential tenants are prevented from competing for housing on the basis of price, the biases of landlords play a far greater role in the distribution of housing. It is far easier to deny housing to minority groups when they are kept from outbidding the majority. Rent control also shifts the housing stock towards ownership, as properties are shifted off the rental market and become unaffordable for economically disadvantaged people. This widens the geographic and economic barriers between the haves and have-nots.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rent control’s failure has been well-known among economists for decades, but the policy survives because it benefits interest groups and politicians. Current tenants receive artificially cheaper housing, and politicians garner political points through posing as protectors of the common man from greedy landlords. Rent control’s revival is representative of the increasingly populist political environment of America. The American public is losing faith in the market to provide solutions and is more willing to exchange individual liberty for quick fixes from central planners. Lowering housing costs will not come from shortcuts like rent control; it will come from allowing developers to build. Unleashing supply will lower rent, decrease homelessness, and reduce the cost-of-living burden working Americans carry every day.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rent control has failed working Americans for decades. The new provisions from Mamdani and Washington State will be no different. Rent control in Washington State is projected to cause 7,000 fewer units to be built in the next decade, combined with a $1.1 billion reduction in rental property values. Mamdani can blame capitalism for New York City’s housing woes, and doing so has won him votes. However, his own policies are truly at fault. Nearly half of the rental housing in New York City qualifies for rent control, and rent has been completely frozen in qualified units four times in the past decade. Piling on even more rent control will only reduce the financial viability of the rental housing stock, decreasing supply, and raising rent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rent control is an issue that capitalism cannot afford to lose; Americans cannot afford the costs of fewer homes, run-down housing, and higher rent. Rent control is a safety net for politicians, not working Americans.\n",

        "Years ago, progressives defeated a plan to build headquarters for Amazon in Queens. Now a new kind of development is gaining their support.\n",
        "\n",
        "When New York wanted to lure Amazon to western Queens with more than $2 billion of public money in 2018, an ascendant left wing rallied to defeat it. Progressive politicians, headlined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, condemned the move as a corporate giveaway that would accelerate gentrification.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "Seven years later, a much bigger project is on the table. This time it's not about granting hefty public subsidies to one of the biggest companies in the world. Instead, New York City is proposing a huge rezoning in the area that would allow private developers to construct almost 15,000 apartments across 54 blocks currently filled with warehouses and parking lots. A vote in the City Council is expected at the end of the month.\n",
        "\n",
        "The response from Zohran Mamdani, New York's progressive standard-bearer and the Democratic nominee for mayor, has been unmistakably warm.\n",
        "\n",
        "''I'm always excited about the prospect of building additional housing,'' Mr. Mamdani, who also represents the area in the state assembly, said during a recent interview with Errol Louis on NY1.\n",
        "\n",
        "The contrast in tone, from both Mr. Mamdani and the left more broadly, reflects fundamental differences between the plans of 2018 and today.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Amazon effort, with $1.7 billion in incentives from the state and hundreds of millions more from the city, was hatched by company executives and city and state officials. The new plan, in contrast, has followed two years of open negotiations among civic leaders, city officials and residents, and puts a priority on benefits for New Yorkers like affordable housing and park space.\n",
        "\n",
        "But the shift also underscores how the left has increasingly changed its posture toward encouraging private development as a means to solve the city's housing crisis. It also highlights how Mr. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has a more nuanced position on addressing New York City's housing crisis that is often overshadowed by his uncomplicated pledge to freeze rents on rent-stabilized homes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the Long Island City plan, Mr. Mamdani has spoken favorably about Mayor Eric Adams's push to unleash development across the city, otherwise known as ''City of Yes.'' In an interview with The New York Times earlier this year, he said he now accepts that ''there is a very important role'' for the private sector to play in building homes, acknowledging that it was a position he did not previously embrace. He has spoken about finding ways to reduce insurance premiums for landlords and red tape for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "''I think he is generally a pro-development progressive,'' said Alicia Glen, a deputy under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was involved in the negotiations with Amazon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani's top opponent in the mayor's race, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, was one of the architects of the Amazon deal and has made private development a centerpiece of his housing agenda.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Mamdani's campaign declined to answer questions about his position on the plan, pointing instead to comments he made in the NY1 interview on Sept. 25. A spokesman for his assembly office did not respond to questions about the rezoning, referring them to his campaign office.\n",
        "\n",
        "''We are in an affordability crisis,'' Mr. Mamdani said in the NY1 interview. ''We are in dire need of additional housing. And that housing has to be built all across New York City. I'm excited to be the mayor that finally delivers that.''\n",
        "\n",
        "The housing crisis is a top issue in the mayor's race. The city is dealing with the worst housing shortage it has faced in nearly 60 years, and rents remain high, threatening the city's economy and making it difficult for average people to afford to live here.\n",
        "\n",
        "City officials hope that encouraging more development in Long Island City, which has good access to public transportation and offers short commutes to the corporate offices and tourist attractions of Midtown Manhattan, will be a big part of the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Already, parts of Long Island City are booming. After a 2001 rezoning, several towering luxury apartment buildings sprouted in the area, yielding almost 28,000 new housing units between 2010 and 2024 according to Planning Department data, and making the neighborhood one of the fastest-growing places in the country.\n",
        "\n",
        "The new plan would target blocks that were not part of the 2001 rezoning but are in the same general area. They have long been an alluring site for development -- there have been at least five attempts to build on portions of the site since 2015, including in the Amazon deal -- but nothing has yet come to fruition.\n",
        "\n",
        "City officials estimate that a new rezoning, as currently formulated, would make way for 14,700 additional homes, including 4,300 restricted to people of lower incomes that would most likely rent at below-market rates. The plan would also add waterfront park space and create commercial space that could yield some 14,400 jobs, according to city estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "It must, however, be approved by the City Council, which would all but require a go-ahead from Julie Won, the council member who represents the area. The Council traditionally respects the sway of the local representative, a practice known as member deference.\n",
        "\n",
        "In an interview, Ms. Won recalled being part of the opposition to Amazon. ''It didn't reflect anything that our community actually needed,'' she said.\n",
        "\n",
        "She recalled celebrating that plan's demise by smashing a piñata that displayed a picture of the head of the company's founder, Jeff Bezos.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, she said, she wants rezoning to move forward, though she has not yet given the city's plan her endorsement. She said her support hinges on a commitment to more affordable housing than the city is proposing, a connection between nearby parks situated along the waterfront and improvements to local schools, public housing and sewers.\n",
        "\n",
        "She said that Mr. Mamdani has told her that he agrees with her ''red lines.'' In the NY1 interview, he said he is taking Ms. Won's concerns seriously, and that rezoning should be coupled with investments in infrastructure and an increase in connections along the waterfront between neighborhoods that have historically been split apart and segregated.\n",
        "\n",
        "''These are things I would examine very closely,'' he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ms. Won said if the city doesn't change the plan in the coming weeks to address her priorities, she would reject it and work with Mr. Mamdani, should he win the election, to come up with something better. ''We're together on this,'' she said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ms. Glen, now the founder and managing principal at MSquared, a development firm, said it would be ''naïve'' to push the rezoning into the next administration, which might want to spend money on other priorities.\n",
        "\n",
        "''It's a tough needle to thread,'' she said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ms. Won's skepticism of the city's effort -- echoed by activists and other constituents during Council hearings -- illustrates the difficult position Mr. Mamdani is in. Many in his political base are wary of the involvement of private developers in housing solutions and prefer public investment, a dynamic that does not fully align with the city's plan in Long Island City.\n",
        "\n",
        "''When we are facing this level of housing crisis, I support only deeply affordable housing,'' said Mary Jobaida, a democratic socialist who has lived in Long Island City for 20 years and is running for Mr. Mamdani's assembly seat. ''No mixed income. We need to solve the immediate problem.''\n",
        "\n",
        "Ms. Jobaida, who immigrated from Bangladesh, opposes the city's plan, as she opposed the Amazon development. ''Our fight continues,'' she said.\n",

        "Rents all over the country are too darn high – and thanks to the New York City mayoral campaign, discussions about how to control them are back in the national attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "Housing is at the heart of the campaign of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee – and \"freeze the rent\" is one of its key planks. As Mamdani explains it, millions of New Yorkers live in \"rent stabilized\" homes, where annual increases are determined by a government board. Mamdani says he wants to halt annual increases for four years, after a period in which incumbent Mayor Eric Adams allowed rent to rise as much as 9% a year. While rent stabilization may feel like a holy grail for tenants lucky enough to snag such a deal, limiting how much landlords can charge is a blunt tool that won't solve the affordability crisis – and might even make it worse, experts say. The best way to make rent more manageable, most housing observers believe, is to take a broad-based approach to overall housing affordability, including by increasing supply and easing local restrictions – which Mamdani has also proposed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Rent control lowers costs for some residents, but it raises costs for more residents, so overall that is net negative for affordability,\" said Alex Horowitz, project director for housing policy at The Pew Charitable Trusts. \"The most important driver of housing affordability is whether there are enough homes. When there aren't enough homes, that creates competition for homes that are scarce. So prices get bid up and rents get bid up, which creates a long-term seller's market and a long-term landlord's market.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Austin, Denver have seen\n",
        "\n",
        "rents decrease\n",
        "\n",
        "Such arguments aren't just economics textbook ideas, Horowitz and other observers say. There are multiple real-world examples of American cities experimenting with increasing supply, and having rents fall as a result. Salim Furth, an economist who directs the Urbanity project at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, offers Denver and Austin as recent examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Denver, a surge of new construction led to a 6.4% vacancy rate as of this summer, and declining rents, according to a landlord advocacy group. It's the same story in Austin, where rents are still above where they were pre-pandemic, but down from the 2023 peak. (By contrast, New York City had a vacancy rate of 1.4% as of 2024, the most recent data available.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Unintended consequences\n",
        "\n",
        "of rent control\n",
        "\n",
        "Efforts to control rental increases have led to unintended yet serious consequences, observers say.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gonzalo Respighi Grasso, a doctoral candidate in economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has made rent control the focus of his research. He cites a 2019 paper that looked at the effects of implementing rent control in San Francisco in 1994.\n",
        "\n",
        "Landlords responded to that policy by converting for-rent apartments to owner-occupied condos or by encouraging redevelopment that would allow new construction to be exempt from rent control. Meanwhile, tenants who lived in homes that became rent-controlled had far less incentive to leave, which wound up limiting their mobility, according to the 2019 paper and other research, Respighi Grasso explained in an interview with USA TODAY.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Since many of the existing rental properties were converted to higher-end, owner-occupied condominium housing and new construction rentals, the passage of rent control ultimately led to a housing stock which caters to higher income individuals,\" the 2019 paper concluded. \"It appears rent control has actually contributed to the gentrification of San Francisco, the exact opposite of the policy's intended goal. Indeed, by simultaneously bringing in higher-income residents and preventing displacement of minorities, rent control has contributed to widening income inequality of the city.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Should government play\n",
        "\n",
        "a role in housing?\n",
        "\n",
        "While rent control may not be the panacea some hope for, observers agree that some measure of government assistance is needed, given the scope of the housing crisis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Across the nation, a whopping half of all renters are \"cost-burdened\" as of 2023, the most recent data available, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing and utilities. That includes the 27% who spend more than half of their income on those expenses. In New York, that's 856,800 households, according to an analysis of city data performed by the Citizens Budget Commission for USA TODAY.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Some people aren't going to have enough money to afford decent housing, even in a market that has a lot of homes,\" Pew's Horowitz said in an interview. Subsidies such as housing choice vouchers may be solid policy choices for lower-income residents, he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "And Marie Claire Tran-Leung, who leads the Evictions Initiative Project at the National Housing Law Project, stresses the importance of protections for tenants as prices spike higher in many jurisdictions and the federal government pulls back on housing efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Rent stabilization works in concert with other tenant protections,\" Tran-Leung told USA TODAY. \"In this environment, protection against landlord retaliation is especially important because the rents that tenants may have in a given place are only as good as they are enforced.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The National Housing Law Project and others are also engaged in efforts to help tenants access legal representation in the court system, she said. \"We often work with tenants who may have a viable claim against the landlord, but the landlord can easily make a case for nonpayment.\"\n",

        "Eric Adams is just the second Black mayor elected in New York City, and his downfall has been painful for many who supported him.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Eric Adams took office nearly four years ago, many New Yorkers welcomed the ascension of the city's second Black mayor.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a milestone that had taken nearly three decades to reach: The first Black mayor, David N. Dinkins, had lost his re-election campaign in 1993. Mr. Adams's rise was important symbolically and practically for many Black voters who were eager to see life improve for communities that had often been overlooked.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, with Mr. Adams's decision on Sunday to end his campaign for re-election amid sagging poll numbers -- and the confirmation that New York City will have had two single-term Black mayors -- some worry that his rocky tenure could undermine Black political power in New York.\n",
        "\n",
        "For years, the city's Black electorate has served as a make-or-break base of support for Democratic mayors. But Zohran Mamdani, the party's mayoral nominee, won the June primary with a coalition that did not include many majority Black precincts. (Since his victory, Mr. Mamdani has focused on reaching out to Black voters and secured endorsements from prominent Black leaders; a New York Times/Siena poll this month shows he now leads his rivals among likely Black voters.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Donovan Richards, the Queens borough president who is viewed as a possible future contender for City Hall, said despite Mr. Adams's downfall, he did not doubt that there would be another Black mayor.\n",
        "\n",
        "''But is this a setback?'' he said. ''Yes.''\n",
        "\n",
        "The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who has been both an ally and a critic of Mr. Adams, said that said that there was a ''widespread feeling of sadness'' over the mayor's fate. He also expressed concern that promising Black leaders could face a higher bar in the future to prove they are ''squeaky clean.''\n",
        "\n",
        "But he said Mr. Adams could not overcome concerns about his relationship with President Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Adams, 65, was charged last year with abusing his office to obtain travel benefits and illegal foreign campaign contributions. The Trump administration asked for the charges to be dropped after Mr. Adams struck an alliance with the president.\n",
        "\n",
        "As Mr. Adams heads for the exit, a new generation of Black leaders is rising through the political ranks, including Mr. Richards, 42; Antonio Delgado, 48, the state's lieutenant governor; Vanessa Gibson, 46, the Bronx borough president; and leaders in the City Council like Crystal Hudson, 42, who represents Crown Heights and other neighborhoods in Brooklyn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ms. Hudson, a top contender to be the next Council speaker, said Mr. Adams's trajectory would not undermine other Black politicians.\n",
        "\n",
        "''I don't think it limits the future and potential of Black leadership because there are many of us who are working hard,'' she said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Adams's victory came at a moment when many New York officials were the first Black leaders to hold their jobs, including Adrienne Adams, the Council speaker; Letitia James, the state attorney general; and Carl Heastie, the speaker of the State Assembly.\n",
        "\n",
        "As early as his first year in office, Mr. Adams began to draw parallels between himself and Mr. Dinkins, whose victory in 1989 was a truly groundbreaking moment. Mr. Adams and his allies argued that both had faced racist criticism and were portrayed as incompetent. But Mr. Adams and Mr. Dinkins were very different leaders -- in style and substance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Dinkins, a liberal Democrat who died in 2020, ran on the idea that the city was a ''gorgeous mosaic'' where neighbors from different backgrounds could coexist. Mr. Adams, a conservative Democrat, ran as a former police officer who would bring down crime and highlighted the diversity of his administration. Mr. Dinkins was known to be reserved and diplomatic; Mr. Adams is outspoken and combative, attacking gentrification and those on the left.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the mayor's poll numbers began to crater, he took to calling himself ''David Dinkins 2.'' Allies of Mr. Dinkins found that idea preposterous.\n",
        "\n",
        "Patrick Gaspard, a distinguished senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and an informal adviser to Mr. Mamdani, worked as an aide to Mr. Dinkins. He argued that Mr. Adams did not compare to Mr. Dinkins in terms of his legacy or as a model for Black leadership.\n",
        "\n",
        "''Eric Adams was a colorful and clever figure who knew how to leverage biography for a particular moment in a fractured field when New Yorkers were trying to survive a global shutdown,'' Mr. Gaspard said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Dinkins failed to secure a second term after a pivotal moment in 1991 when a driver in a rabbi's motorcade hit and killed a Black child in Crown Heights. Mr. Dinkins struggled with how to respond to the resulting violence, an episode that was a crucial factor in his loss to Rudolph Giuliani in 1993.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Adams, in contrast, has faced a wave of criticism on many fronts: budget cuts early in his term to libraries and free preschool; his handling of an influx of immigrants from the southern border; his federal corruption indictment last year; investigations into many people in his inner circle; and his coziness with Mr. Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "As Mr. Adams's mayoralty started to crumble, his support among likely Black voters, his most loyal backers, also sank. It fell to 11 percent, compared with 41 percent for Mr. Mamdani, according to the Times/Siena poll.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many Black leaders said that Mr. Adams had no one to blame but himself. Mr. Richards credited Mr. Adams for investing in neighborhoods like Southeast Queens and in affordable housing. He also agreed that Black elected officials are sometimes held to a different standard.\n",
        "\n",
        "But Mr. Adams made poor decisions about the people he surrounded himself with, Mr. Richards said, and was ''loyal to a fault.'' As more and more people Mr. Adams had handpicked for his administration began to face corruption charges and allegations, an ''undeniable pattern developed,'' Mr. Richards added.\n",

        "''When we see you in bed with Trump, we can't forgive that,'' Mr. Richards said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Adams emerged victorious from a crowded Democratic primary field in 2021 by focusing on his biography, discussing his struggle with dyslexia and saying he was beaten by the police as a teenager. He made the powerful argument that his life experiences gave him the ability to strike a balance between public safety and respecting people's civil rights.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the center of many of his stories was his mother, Dorothy Mae Adams-Streeter, a house cleaner who raised six children in poverty. At his inauguration in Times Square, Mr. Adams held a framed portrait of his mother in a brandy snifter -- an image that connected with the Black and immigrant families who voted for him.\n",
        "\n",
        "He brought out her image again on Sunday when he announced he would suspend his campaign, placing a poster of her next to him on the stairs inside Gracie Mansion.\n",

        "\n",
        "Some Black leaders have lamented the way that the mayor's accomplishments have been overshadowed by scandal.

        "\n",
        "''The numbers don't lie,'' he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "But even some longtime allies saw before the primary that Mr. Adams represented the past, not the future. Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, the chairwoman of the Brooklyn Democratic Party and a close friend of the mayor, endorsed Mr. Cuomo in March and then Mr. Mamdani in June.\n",
        "\n",
        "She was with Mr. Mamdani at Clarendon Road Church in Brooklyn on Sunday and said that he was winning over Black voters, many of whom voted for Mr. Cuomo during the primary.\n",

        "Let’s be honest: The phrase “political economy” inspires little to no emotion, even for those majoring in the subject. Some choose it because it’s easier than straight-up economics but still sounds fancy enough on a resume. In our mandated classical theories lecture, I’d glance over shoulders to see my classmates online shopping, manically job searching, playing chess or — my personal diversion of choice — reading the news.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "At 11:55 p.m., I’d hit submit and watch my compare and contrast assignment vanish into the ether, wondering how on earth this could possibly help my career. Surely employers will see just how eloquently I juxtaposed Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” with Karl Polanyi’s concept of the double movement. “This guy gets it!” they’ll say, and hire me on the spot. Right?\n",
        "\n",
        "I’d often leave lecture early and return to the “real world” — my job in San Francisco, canvassing for democratic socialist city supervisor Dean Preston’s electoral campaign. Convincing a constituent of his proven policy agenda brought me more hope than any 200-word reading summary ever could. He prevented countless evictions, taxed high-end real-estate sales to fund social housing, restored critical bus lines, championed bike lanes, turned deserted motels into housing for the homeless, supported nonviolent community ambassadors over bloated police budgets and relieved small business owners of pandemic back rent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Preston’s policies delivered for those least well-off at a time when they needed someone like him the most. But in a city dominated by Big Tech, it didn’t seem to matter at all. His challenger received boatloads of funding from venture capitalist and CEO of renowned tech startup accelerator Y Combinator, Garry Tan. Beyond brandishing the necessary capital to flood YouTube ads with misinformation about Preston’s record, the all-consuming social and cultural byproducts of the tech industry — gentrification, social dislocation and work-from-home isolation — sapped San Francisco’s political soil of the nutrients required for a broad-coalition grassroots socialist movement.\n",
        "\n",
        "There were forces out of any one person or campaign’s control, which I could not see at the time. I had a feverish faith in the campaign. After months of relentless door-knocking, reality knocked back. We lost the race, and in retrospect, I cringe at my own naivete. I retreated into my academics, got a research assistant job and resumed my in-class news scrolling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, just a few months ago, a certain headline arrested my attention. A democratic socialist 3,000 miles away, Zohran Mamdani, won the Democratic Party nomination for New York City mayor, and for some reason, now all I could think about was … Karl Polanyi.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was his theory of the “double movement” put into action: a perpetual swinging between the voracious drive of unregulated markets and the corresponding countermovements that arise to protect communities from its destructive effects. When basic needs and public services such as food, housing and transportation are commodified and kept out of reach, society will inevitably fight back simply to preserve itself. Mamdani’s win was that counter punch — a crack in the neoliberal order of old.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a Bay Area resident, watching Mamdani ignites both great hope for a brighter future and deep anger toward our current San Francisco mayor and billionaire executive, Daniel Lurie. While Mamdani promises to make city buses faster and free, Lurie just cut crucial bus lines that so many working people rely on daily, replacing them with costly Waymos.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Mamdani plans to freeze the rent and triple the city’s production of permanently affordable rent-stabilized homes, Lurie is going all in on an upzoning plan that will demolish modest single-family and duplex homes, displacing the city’s middle-class backbone in favor of high-end market-rate apartments that few working families can afford.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Mamdani prepares to bring food prices down by introducing city-run, locally sourced grocery stories, Lurie just passed a budget which slashed funds for countless nonprofits providing critical homelessness services and food programs, shuttering pantries such as HOMEY’s “La Ofrenda” serving youth and families in the Mission District, as well as forcing Project Open Hand’s Curry Senior Center to turn away the Tenderloin’s elderly, estimating a yearly cutback of 100,000 free hot meals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Along with policy, it is Mamdani’s authentic style of communication that makes him such a successful conduit for change. Lurie, on the other hand, puts forth rather disingenuous arguments to justify his budget, claiming it “required painful decisions” to address the deficit. In reality, he avoided making an obvious decision that would save these programs — taxing the rich — precisely because it would have been painful, but only for him and his billionaire buds. One among them is OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who now holds a top advisory role in Lurie’s office.\n",
        "\n",
        "As Lurie continues to enrage his working-class constituents with each passing day, when will San Francisco finally punch back? Well, it’s already starting.\n",
        "\n",
        "In June, before the budget passed, hundreds of protestors packed San Francisco City Hall, booming chants such as, “Whose budget? Our budget!” and holding signs reading, “No new jail, no cuts,” alluding to how eliminating public services gives cause to the very crime Lurie ran on cleaning up. Earlier that same month, the People’s Budget Coalition, a collective of nonprofits and activists, organized a rally outside city hall that attracted thousands.\n",
        "\n",
        "Political momentum in San Francisco is shifting, and we UC Berkeley students would do well to be part of it. While your stay here may be temporary, you can get practice in political organizing by joining the Democratic Socialists of America’s growing political movement, finding hope in Mamdani’s model and sowing the seeds of justice wherever you may land. And if you do want to stay in the Bay Area, your choice to mobilize against the billionaires’ privatizing agenda will impact whether or not you can afford to live in that beautiful city just across the water.\n",
        "\n",
        "In my spell of jaded inaction, one quote from Thucydides really hit home: “The society that separates its scholars from its warriors will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting done by fools.” Political organizing while in school allows us to avoid being both cowardly scholars and foolish warriors. Let us transform our studies into meaningful change.\n",

        "Rents all over the country are too darn high – and thanks to the New York City mayoral campaign, discussions about how to control them are back in the national attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Housing is at the heart of the campaign of Zohran Mamdani [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/25/zohran-mamdani-platform-policies-issues/84350898007/], the Democratic nominee – and “freeze the rent” is one of its key planks. As Mamdani explains it, millions of New Yorkers live in “rent stabilized” homes, where annual increases are determined by a government board. Mamdani says he wants to halt annual increases for four years, after a period in which incumbent Mayor Eric Adams allowed rent to rise as much as 9% a year.\n",
        "\n",
        "TD\n",
        "\n",
        "While rent stabilization may feel like a holy grail for tenants lucky enough to snag such a deal, limiting how much landlords can charge is a blunt tool that won’t solve the affordability crisis – and might even make it worse, experts say. The best way to make rent more manageable, most housing observers believe, is to take a broad-based approach to overall housing affordability, including by increasing supply and easing local restrictions – which Mamdani has also proposed [https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform].\n",
        "\n",
        "“Rent control lowers costs for some residents, but it raises costs for more residents, so overall that is net negative for affordability,” said Alex Horowitz, project director for housing policy at The Pew Charitable Trusts. “The most important driver of housing affordability is whether there are enough homes. When there aren't enough homes, that creates competition for homes that are scarce. So prices get bid up and rents get bid up, which creates a long-term seller's market and a long-term landlord's market.”\n",

It’s the same story in Austin [https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/22/austin-texas-rents-falling/], where rents are still above where they were pre-pandemic, but down from the 2023 peak.

        "Gonzalo Respighi Grasso, a doctoral candidate in economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has made rent control the focus of his research. He cites a 2019 paper [https://www-aeaweb-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181289] that looked at the effects of implementing rent control in San Francisco in 1994.\n",
        "\n",
        "Landlords responded to that policy by converting for-rent apartments to owner-occupied condos or by encouraging redevelopment that would allow new construction to be exempt from rent control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meanwhile, tenants who lived in homes that became rent-controlled had far less incentive to leave, which wound up limiting their mobility, according to the 2019 paper and other research [https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/science/article/pii/S1051137724000020], Respighi Grasso explained in an interview with USA TODAY.\n",

        "\n",
        "“Since many of the existing rental properties were converted to higher-end, owner-occupied condominium housing and new construction rentals, the passage of rent control ultimately led to a housing stock which caters to higher income individuals,” the 2019 paper concluded.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It appears rent control has actually contributed to the gentrification of San Francisco, the exact opposite of the policy’s intended goal. Indeed, by simultaneously bringing in higher-income residents and preventing displacement of minorities, rent control has contributed to widening income inequality of the city.”\n",

        "Should government play a role in housing?\n",
        "\n",
        "While rent control may not be the panacea some hope for, observers agree that some measure of government assistance is needed, given the scope of the housing crisis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Across the nation, a whopping half of all renters are “cost-burdened” as of 2023, the most recent data available [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/06/24/americas-housing-expensive-inaccessible-harvard-report/83533083007/], meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing and utilities. That includes the 27% who spend more than half of their income on those expenses. In New York, that's 856,800 households, according to an analysis of city data [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/about/2023-nychvs-selected-initial-findings.pdf] performed by the Citizens Budget Commission for USA TODAY.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Some people aren't going to have enough money to afford decent housing, even in a market that has a lot of homes,” Pew’s Horowitz said in an interview. Subsidies such as housing choice vouchers may be solid policy choices for lower-income residents, he said.\n",

        "\n",
        "The National Housing Law Project and others are also engaged in efforts to help tenants access legal representation in the court system, she said. “We often work with tenants who may have a viable claim against the landlord, but the landlord can easily make a case for nonpayment.”\n",

        "And right now a memorial for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk is happening at the Kennedy Center. You're looking inside there live. This comes as President Trump said just moments ago that he plans to attend Kirk's memorial in Arizona next weekend. That's happening next Sunday.\n",
        "\n",
        "Right now, the suspect accused in the killing of Charlie Kirk is in a special jail unit under close watch pending a mental health evaluation. Utah County Sheriff's officials say the 22-year-old is expected to be there for a few days. His first court appearance is slated for Tuesday.\n",
        "\n",
        "And take a look. This is newly obtained video from the AP showing a man who looks like the suspect walking the neighborhood about a half mile from the murder scene at Utah Valley University. You can see this person in the clip is wearing clothing and driving a Dodge that matches the description given by Utah's governor about the killer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's bring in CNN's Danny Freeman, who is there in St. George, Utah, where the shooting suspect was living.\n",
        "\n",
        "Danny, we got some -- a lot of new information about this suspect today from the state's governor, including who he was living with. Tell us more.\n",
        "\n",
        "DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. That's right, Jessica. Listen, authorities are really trying to understand more about 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, the suspected killer of Charlie Kirk here, because they're trying to figure out what may have led this man who otherwise was living, as far as we understand, a fairly normal life to ultimately allegedly pull that trigger earlier this week.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two new updates that are notable from the governor of Utah that we learned today. First, on the roommate of Tyler Robinson. Now the roommate, per the governor, was a romantic partner of Robinson, who was a male transitioning to female. But the governor emphasized that this roommate has been incredibly cooperative with authorities.\n",
        "\n",
        "And I want you to take a listen to how the governor characterized really the roommate's reaction when the roommate learned that Robinson was the main suspect here.\n",
        "\n",
        "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n",
        "\n",
        "GOV. SPENCER COX (R), UTAH: This person did not have any knowledge was shocked when they when they found out about it -- when he found out about it. The suspect has not been cooperating so far. And so we're getting all of this information from family members and people around the suspect.\n",
        "\n",
        "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n",
        "\n",
        "FREEMAN: So again, interesting to note there, Jessica, that the roommate in question has been cooperating with authorities. But as far as we understand, Tyler Robinson himself has not been at this point. By the way, CNN asked Governor Cox during that interview if the roommate was at all a part or directly part of the motive for potentially Robinson opening fire at Kirk. And the governor said it's easy to draw conclusions, but he declined to speculate further.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the other thing that we learned today, Jessica, was this possibility of a potential note left behind by Robinson. According to the social gaming platform Discord, a roommate and a friend of Robinson actually mentioned, quote, \"contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the governor said -- basically he appeared to confirm the existence of such a note, but the governor did not go as far as to detail what may have been inside any note that Robinson may have left behind. So that's going to be something that we're certainly going to be asking more questions about over the next few days.\n",
        "\n",
        "The biggest thing that we're looking ahead towards, Jessica, though, is this coming Tuesday. That's when formal charges are expected to be announced here in Utah. And that's when we're expecting to see Robinson make his first court appearance again here in the state of Utah -- Jessica.\n",
        "\n",
        "DEAN: All right, Danny Freeman with the latest. Thank you for that.\n",
        "\n",
        "As I mentioned, we heard from President Trump just a few moments ago when he spoke about his close friend and those who are also celebrating his close friend Charlie Kirk's death. Listen to this.\n",

        "\n",
        "KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And you do hear the president continuing these very sharp denunciations of the left. He says that political violence in the United States is a problem exclusively on the left side of politics essentially saying that it is not an issue on the right side of politics.\n",
        "\n",
        "And that is essentially a continuation of what we've heard from the president really in the hours since we learned that Charlie Kirk had died. The president put out that video from the Oval Office denouncing what he called left-wing radicals and continuing to really sort of go after his political opponents as people he says are exclusively responsible for political violence in the United States.\n",
        "\n",
        "[19:05:06]\n",

        "\n",
        "TRUMP: Well, the problem is on the left. If you look at the problem, the problem is on the left. It's not on the right. Like some people like to say on the right. The problem we have is on the left. And when you look at the agitators, the - you look at the scum that speak so badly of our country, the American flag burnings all over the place. That's the left. That's not the right.\n",

        "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n",
        "\n",
        "LIPTAK: Now, in reality here, both Democrats and Republicans have been targets of political violence over the last several years, including those lawmakers in Minnesota, including the governor of Pennsylvania. There are a number of Republicans who have been targeted by political violence, including President Trump himself. So it's a problem across the political spectrum.\n",
        "\n",
        "But clearly, President Trump very focused on his opponents here in the aftermath of this assassination. The other question that I think is unanswered from the president is what specifically he plans to do about it. We know we heard just last week from the chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who said that even before the Charlie Kirk assassination that the White House was working on a plan to combat violence and radicalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "We don't have any details of that plan yet. But President Trump, I think, clearly not taking a particularly unifying approach here, but certainly very angry at some of those he is accusing of political violence in the aftermath of this event -- Jessica.\n",
        "\n",
        "DEAN: All right. Kevin Liptak at the White House, thanks so much.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's bring in some CNN political commentators, David Urban and Maria Cardona. David is a Republican strategist and former Trump campaign adviser, and Maria is a Democratic strategist.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm glad you guys are both here. We've had a hell of a week here in the United States, and I think as people kind of start to grapple with what has happened and what happens next.\n",
        "\n",
        "David, we hear a lot from the Utah governor, Spencer Cox, who a lot of people have looked to because of his steady hand in all of this. And he posed this question this week that I think a lot of people are thinking about, which is, does this assassination mark the end of an era or does it mark the beginning of something else? What do you think?\n",
        "\n",
        "DAVID URBAN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes. Jess, let's hope it marks the end and the beginning. Right? Let's hope that it marks the end of an era of political violence and the beginning of something new. Too many people think that pain, it's kind of notion that pain is a debt that must be repaid in the same currency. Right? So an eye for an eye. They seek revenge, and they won't be happy until that happens.\n",
        "\n",
        "And you know, Governor Cox has been incredible. And echoing Charlie Kirk's own words that when we start talking, when we stop, you know, interacting with one another, that's when the problems become, that's when violence occurs. And so I think the best thing that can be done is to, you know, kind of play Charlie Kirk's tapes on a loop and let people see what the -- what the man stood for, what he believed in.\n",
        "\n",
        "And I think that that would be, you know, an appeal to our better angels. Let Charlie speak from where he, you know, in the afterlife. Now is even more powerful to hear his own words, to say, look, we got to sit down. We've got to talk to one another. If we stop doing that bad things happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "Listen, I liked -- Senator Curtis from Utah today said we need to remove the word -- we need to remove radical left, radical right, and just talk about radicals in general, because there are -- there are individuals on both sides that do these things. You know, my friend, Governor Shapiro was almost killed, his family almost burned to death in his own mansion. And so the president does those speak -- Jess, look, he has had two attempts on his life, so he's got a right to be angry and think that this comes from the left because he's speaking from his own personal experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "So it's a tough, tough week as you said. We're going to have more tough weeks ahead and hope we do find the off ramp.\n",
        "\n",
        "DEAN: Maria, what do you -- what do you think about all of that?\n",
        "\n",
        "MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I agree with David. It has been a horrendous week. And it is a time for all of us to look inward and then act outward to see what we can do to do better, to bring down the temperature, to throw water on the fire. And my concern with the words of President Trump is that he probably is the one that people are looking to most to be the unifier, to be someone that is going to bring everyone together at this really difficult moment in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Look, David is right. There were two attempts on his life. He has a right to be angry, but he also has a bigger responsibility than anyone else in this country because he is the president of the United States. He's not just some Joe Schmo.\n",
        "\n",
        "[19:10:02]\n",
        "\n",
        "So the words that he speaks actually matter, and they impact the people that need most to hear that we are at a crossroads. And you know what, Jessica, and I think David would agree with me, I think, you know, what would honor Charlie Kirk best is if we all see this as a turning point in this country. A turning point where we all look at each other and say, we're not our enemies. We can speak out at the top of our lungs about the issues that we care about, and we advocate for.\n",
        "\n",
        "And look, some of the things that Charlie Kirk said and advocated for, I abhor. And were offensive and were hurtful to so many people in many, many communities. That in no way means that he deserved what happened to him. Absolutely not. That is the definition of free speech that he can say those things and others who oppose him can say they oppose them at the top of their lungs.\n",
        "\n",
        "That's America. And America is tough. But if we actually want free speech, if we actually want that kind of elevated citizenship, then we have to understand that the way to show how we oppose one another and frankly, hopefully where we find united ground is by talking and so in that David is right. In that Charlie Kirk is right. And we need to continue to talk to each other. And again I go back to the one who has the biggest responsibility in this, is Donald Trump.\n",
        "\n",
        "But we have seen that he -- it's not in his DNA. He doesn't seem to be willing and able to bring people together. He just focuses on the left. But hey, maybe it is a turning point. Maybe hell surprise all of us.\n",
        "\n",
        "DEAN: David, I know you speak with the president, with his advisers frequently. I don't know if you've had a chance to talk to them since all of this has happened, and I know clearly, as you very well point out, he's had two attempts on his life. That will give you a point of view. And this was an actual friend of his and a friend of his family's, his children as well. So that certainly colors this as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "But I'm wondering if you've spoken to them at all or if you can kind of give people a window into their thinking about this. To Maria's point, people who maybe want a more consoler-in-chief right now, do you think that that -- like, what's their thinking around that?\n",
        "\n",
        "URBAN: Yes. Listen, you know, Charlie -- I met Charlie during the 2016 campaign. Charlie Kirk, you know, was an Eagle Scout in high school, applied to go to West Point, was, you know, was a -- was an all- American, kind of was all-American kind of kid. And he's been around, you know, the Trump world for roughly a decade now. So people really, you know, you got to be close friends with that guy, he became part of the family.\n",
        "\n",
        "So his death is a great loss. His assassination, his murder is a great loss. And it angers a great deal of people. You know, Jessica, it really does make people angry that here's Charlie Kirk doing it the right way. He was out there saying, look, if you don't agree with me, sit down and debate. And some of the best, you know, best moments he had and some of the most gentle and kind moments you'd see, you can -- you can kind of Google it and look it up now on -- you know, on the -- on the internet with people he, you know, really disagrees with.\n",
        "\n",
        "That, you know, he has a, he a kind, gentle soul. And he'd get some heated arguments. But at the end of the day, he was doing it the right way. He was, you know, this is what democracy is about is disagreeing. But not being disagreeable. And he was struck down. And so right now there's still a great deal of anger. And the challenge for everybody who feels anger right now and rightfully so, is how to -- is how to channel that anger into something positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "You know, you don't want to have revenge and retribution. You need to just turn it into some sort of renewal of spirit, renewal of civility. And getting there is not going to be easy. You know, Governor Cox today talked about conflict entrepreneurs, right? These people who benefit from conflict in America, who, you know, look at Mark Zuckerberg doesn't let his daughters have phones or have screen time because he's afraid of what might happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "What does that tell us? You know, put down your phones as he said, touch grass, do things that get us, you know, get us to a place of more civility. Talk to people. Right? Whether they're in line with you at the, at the airport or the grocery store, get to know one another in your neighborhoods.\n",
        "\n",
        "America has lost connectivity with one another. And I think that's a great deal. What's underlying this? And so channeling that anger into something positive is going to be difficult. It starts with things like tonight, this prayer vigil at the Kennedy Center, which is going on, thousands of people are lined up. There'll be a funeral coming up at the stadium this Sunday as you heard the president say.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, you know, it's not going to be a thing that happens overnight, Jess. And the cards are, you know, really stacked against us in terms of how the algorithms reward people who are controversial, who are hateful. They don't reward people who get along.\n",
        "\n",
        "[19:15:02]\n",
        "\n",
        "DEAN: Yes. And we are looking at images coming out of the Kennedy Center where that -- where that tribute is going on right now that David was just talking about.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maria, I'll give you the last word here, and just remind everyone out there that, look, people like you and David are -- you're apart right now physically. But you guys are in a green room together a lot. We, you know, a lot of our Republicans and Democrats that we have on CNN spend time together before they come on the show and after the show. And that happens. You guys all have relationships together and can find other things to agree on.\n",
        "\n",
        "CARDONA: That's exactly right, Jessica. That's what I was going to point out. David and I are doing it right now. David and I exchange texts all the time. He asked me how I'm doing. I ask him how he's doing. We, you know, talk about what we're up to. We talk about how we like the segment, what we didn't like about a segment after we were on. So, yes, this happens. And if you all recall, our dear friend Alice Stewart and I did it every single time we were on together. That was our brand.\n",
        "\n",
        "So it's not impossible. It's actually something that if you give it a chance, if you actually focus on the ideas and the arguments, and you are confident in what you are saying and why you believe you are right, then you should have the space and the confidence to hear an opposing view and maybe you learn something. Not necessarily that you're going to agree or suddenly change your mind.\n",
        "\n",
        "But no, you know, one of the things that I learned a lot every time I hear David talk, I learned a lot every time I sat down with Alice. I learned why she believes what she believes. What is the background to that. David gives us insight all the time about why President Trump believes what he believes, and perhaps why he might act on those beliefs, why the MAGA faithful do what they do.\n",
        "\n",
        "And all of that is important for all of us to know because the more that you know where your opponent is, the better it is -- the better you are going to be equipped to be able to make an argument for your side, but then also focus on civility and respect and decency. And that's what I think we all need to be doing better.\n",
        "\n",
        "DEAN: All right. Well, David and Maria, thank you for being here again.\n",
        "\n",
        "URBAN: Jess, thanks for having us.\n",

        "DEAN: The fallout from Charlie Kirk's killing has spread to the workplace. People are getting fired for comments that seem to celebrate or glorify the assassination of the MAGA activist and father of two young children. These companies and organizations have reported either terminating or suspending employees for posts about Kirk, and that includes Middle Tennessee State University firing a worker they say had, quote, \"zero empathy\" for Kirk's death.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conservative activists, Republican lawmakers, and even a doxing Web site are flagging the comments in what critics say is a campaign to punish those posters.\n",

        "Let's bring in Jessica Kriegel, the chief strategy officer of Culture Partners.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jessica, thanks so much for being here with us. Look, there is, of course, the First Amendment and freedom to speech in this country, but there's also private companies who hire people. And it would seem to me, if it's a private company, they get to -- they get to decide who they want to hire and fire. What do you -- what do you think?\n",
        "\n",
        "JESSICA KRIEGEL, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, CULTURE PARTNERS: Absolutely. They don't need a reason to fire you if you're an at will employee, which most workers in the U.S. are at will contracts. So they can fire you because you wore green instead of blue one day. It doesn't matter. Really what the leader's job at these private employers is to identify the workers who are aligned with the culture that they're trying to cultivate, the strategy that they have to achieve the results towards their purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "So with American Airlines, for example, they said that the person was suspended because it didn't align with their purpose which is to care for people on life's journeys. That's a perfectly legitimate and actually best practice for how you make decisions around hiring and firing.\n",
        "\n",
        "DEAN: And what about a public sector worker? Are standards different there?\n",
        "\n",
        "KRIEGEL: Yes, certainly. So with the government it's a little bit different, right? And so what they do -- with the government there is the Pickering Balancing Test, which looks essentially back from a 1968 Supreme Court case which asked the question, does this worker's freedom of speech disrupt the government agency's ability to perform its work? And if it does, such as, for example, creating disharmony in the workplace, then that freedom of speech isn't necessarily protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "And so there is different standards. There's a higher bar. However, there still is the ability to if someone is, for example, inciting violence, that that is not protected speech, even for a government worker.\n",
        "\n",
        "DEAN: And so how do you think? I mean, you've outlined all of this well, but, you know, look, in the world of social media where somebody can write something and it lives there for a while, or anybody can find anything, you know, how do you think companies are navigating this? How should they be navigating this?\n",

And we call that the action trap. But great CEOs are taking a moment. They're pausing. They're looking at what experience do I want to create for the workers who are employed here? What beliefs do I want them to hold about me as an employee and myself, the CEO? What do I want them to hold? What beliefs do I want them to hold about the company? And then they're making decisions accordingly. A lot of the CEOs are getting headlines right now because they're firing or suspending people, but there are probably ten times as many CEOs who are having conversations with employees. They've seen something they call the person up. They have a conversation what's going on, and then they're acting appropriately after having more understanding.\n",

        "The city’s neighborhoods are constantly evolving, but the current wave of change is marked by unprecedented rent increases, upscale development in formerly overlooked areas, and heightened risk of displacement for low- and middle-income New Yorkers.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the same time, resistance has also grown. From local residents who successfully beat back projects deemed “megaprojects for the rich,” to elected officials like Zohran Mamdani pushing for stronger tenant rights, the fight against displacement is shaping city policy and politics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a city as dynamic as New York, the challenge moving forward will be balancing growth and investment with inclusivity and equity, ensuring that longtime New Yorkers can remain and thrive in the communities they built, even as those communities change.\n",
        "\n",
        "The debate continues on how best to achieve that balance, but it’s clear that gentrification’s has negative impacts, and the responses to it are goind to involve the key actors we analyse, that's is the people who will define **the next chapter of New York City’s urban story.**"
