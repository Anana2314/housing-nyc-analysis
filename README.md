# 🏙️ How New Yorkers Talk About Housing: Public Sentiment and Media Framing

Final Project — Text Analysis Course
*Author:* Ana Clara Montañez

## Project Overview

This project analyzes how New Yorkers discuss the housing crisis across two major sources of public discourse:
YouTube comments on videos related to housing, gentrification, and Zohran Mamdani.
Mainstream media coverage, using Factiva news articles and spaCy Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key political actors.
Through sentiment analysis, word frequency visualization, and network analysis, the project explores public reactions, policy narratives, and media framing around one of the most urgent issues in New York City: housing.

 ## Objectives

Understand how online communities emotionally respond to NYC’s housing crisis. Identify the most common themes and concerns in YouTube comments.
Map key actors in media discourse through NER and co-mention networks. Visualize political relationships to see who shapes the conversation around housing, affordability, and gentrification.
